Topic: Use Cases

<phil_l_(p1)> Use case reviews for today's agenda
<phil_l_(p1)> Brief review of GitHub for IMS GLOBAL re: OBv3 
  proposal has been presented (making open badges VC compatible)
<phil_l_(p1)> Some discussion/pushback in the comments of the 
  discussion.
<phil_l_(p1)> Both the OBv3 proposal for open badges and the CLR 
  are important to this community.

<phil_l_(p1)> Use Case review (8 uses cases in issues of GitHub)
Kerri Lemoie: https://github.com/w3c-ccg/vc-ed-use-cases/issues/5
<phil_l_(p1)> issue #5 - who can submit use cases and how?  A 
  google form was set up for W3C VC use cases. The form is set up 
  and the issue is, pending comment closed.
<phil_l_(p1)> Issue #5 closed.
<phil_l_(p1)> Kerri went through the use cases and tagged them to 
  find commonalities and differences.
<phil_l_(p1)> Most use cases fit within the general "trust 
  model".  The point of these use cases is to inform how the work 
  of the W3C VC-EDU workgroup.
<silent monday morning> or lasered focused on the use cases.... 
  (Dimitri)
<phil_l_(p1)> Interesting that all the use cases are issuer to 
  subject.  But it's valuable when you're the subject presenting to 
  someone else (job application or to a new school program).  It 
  would be good to have more use cases in that category.
<kerri_lemoie> Link to analysis: 
  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UshLQ7kxgHkwPCKxwWwKYUDfrcw22vWAM9iMR4MeVCY/edit#gid=1727854867
<phil_l_(p1)> Harder to come up with use cases that aren't issuer 
  to subject.
<phil_l_(p1)> Lot's of times credentials are subject initiated - 
  but with VCs the subject initiated use cases were presented by 
  Kim and Nate.
<jim_goodell> mic issues
<phil_l_(p1)> Dimitri - DCCC: which form do the use cases follow 
  in the DCCC wallet development.  The confusion is that the 
  recipient is often initiating use case and the subject then 
  responds
<phil_l_(p1)> issuer to subject vs. subject to issuer....
Phil Archer:  Who is the focus of the interaction and what 
  direction does that take? IN a presentation, a subject sends a VC 
  in response to a request. [scribe assist by Kerri Lemoie]
<kerri_lemoie> ... Make an abstraction of the protocol distinct 
  from the sharing
Kerri Lemoie: Phil_li: the holder wants to get the request to the 
  third party but the protocol requires that the verifier requests 
  it.
<phil_l_(p1)> It's ok if the use cases are focused on the issuer 
  as long as the protocols supports initiating the transfer from 
  both sides, issuer and third-party recipient or relying party.
<phil_l_(p1)> as long as those how attend the calls understand 
  the scenarios that's good. But more use cases would help.
Kerri Lemoie: Phil_l: In the presentation, the holder can 
  construct a stack of credentials, can use selective disclosure to 
  withold attributes. Not clear how that is expressed when the 
  relying party gets the subset and the relying party wants more.
<phil_l_(p1)> the current proposal for handling progressive 
  disclosure through a series of request, similar to GNAP, request 
  a set of attributes, now please present this second set of 
  attributes... etc.. should  make it explicit in our use cases.
<kerri_lemoie> This is the data model doc this group is working 
  on: https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-ed-models/
<phil_l_(p1)> GNAP protocol explained - the spiritual successor 
  to OAuth2 grant negotiation and authorization protocol - an 
  iterative set of request.  It's not quite central yet to our 
  work.  The HTTP-API is more central to the VC  CCG.  We have the 
  envelope data model in the VC spec, here in VC-EDU is working on 
  the payload spec, the HTTP-API is working on the exchange 
  protocol. How do we request and express credentials?
<phil_l_(p1)> All of the discussions about HTTP-API influence 
  policy and should be discussed in this group. This group needs to 
  explain why, and maintaining the learner at the center.
<kerri> we're just looking at the tags assigned to the current 
  set of use cases.
<phil_l_(p1)> The question is whether a use case (a learner) 
  request from an issuer (e.g., a non-traditional set of 
  individuals) and ask the issuer to verify that.
<jim_goodell> This seems like a valid use case. e.g. Reverse 
  transfer kind of request.
Kerri Lemoie: +1 Jim
<dmitri_zagidulin> what is a reverse transfer?
<phil_l_(p1)> That sounds like it's 'subject' initiated.  
  Particularly work experience related learning and as an employee 
  of the company they want the employer to recognize.
<phil_l_(p1)> Jim notes this sounds like reverse transfer - like 
  as a use case.
<phil_l_(p1)> reverse transfer - student transfers from a CC to a 
  4yr and starts taking courses. In taking these at the 4yr they 
  believe they may have completed the courses required of the AA 
  from the CC and requests that the CC consider the 4y courses 
  they've completed as equivalent to the missing courses from their 
  CC degree program they left before completing.
Kerri Lemoie: https://github.com/w3c-ccg/vc-ed-use-cases/issues/7
<phil_l_(p1)> The model of the reverse credential is related to a 
  military context where some one has attained military 
  achievements and these may be requested for consideration as 
  credit worthy toward a degree award by an educational 
  institution.
<jarlath> I'm not sure how tthis conversation intersects with the 
  Credit for Prior Learning conversation
<phil_l_(p1)> the progressive disclosure pattern may be able to 
  support the non-traditional credential request (employee asking 
  for work experience to be recognized toward some assertion of a 
  credential from the employer).
<jim_goodell> ... and progressive trust
<pl comment> CPL conversation is exactly what this conversation 
  is about.
Kerri Lemoie: https://www.nist.gov/itl/applied-cybersecurity/nice
<phil_l_(p1)> These can be connecting in a use case such as when 
  a criteria for credentials has yet to be defined. E.g., NIST has 
  a criteria for new set of skills in cybersecurity.  Person is out 
  in the workforce and realizes they have met these new criteria 
  and can go back to an issuer to request that recognition and 
  award.
<kerri_lemoie> Reference to this in the draft model doc: 
  https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-ed-models/#example-5-open-skills-assertion-of-ceasncompetency
<jarlath> @Kerri I'll endeavor to attend more of these meetings 
  so I'm more up-to-date with the conversation overall - thx
<kerri_lemoie> All good @Jarlath. Thank you for joining!
<phil_l_(p1)> If there is a machine readable definition of a new 
  set of skills or abilities this can be presented for 
  consideration with evidence of the individual's claim for 
  satisfying them.
Kerri Lemoie: Phil_l: third party may provide an assessment to 
  support assertion of skills learned on the job. Comptia etc  - 
  training may use testing service. Need clarification on who is 
  making assertion.
<phil_l_(p1)> There are a series of interrelated use cases which 
  involve a holder who believes they have achieved demonstration of 
  skills or abilities. The question is where is  holder deriving 
  getting their evidence from?
<phil_l_(p1)> Thanks everyone.
