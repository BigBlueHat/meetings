Juan Caballero is scribing.

Topic: Intros

Andrew Hughes:  Getting back into the game and catch up on spec 
  evolution in the meantime
Bob Wyman:  Been following the conversations for a long time, 
  getting more directly/seriously involved now
<orie> 1969? are you a cobalt developer unicorn?
  ... writing code since 1969 (ðŸ’ª), worked on early email 
  systems, sold hypertext to the guys at CERN... infrastructure for 
  information flows central to democracy
<mprorock> *cobol  i assume orie?
/Me cobalt lol
Manu Sporny:  Glad to have you guys here, thanks

Topic: VC HTTP API Renaming Poll

<manu> Ideas for renaming: 
  https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2021Aug/0124.html
Manu Sporny:  Poll based on email threads over many weeks
  ... using fancy polling software
<andrew_hughes> I think given Orie's text, we should call it the 
  VC Cobalt Unicorn API now
Bob Wyman: https://www.linkedin.com/in/bobwyman/
Mike Prorock: +1 Cobalt Unicorn
  ... will be run 2 days from now, open for a week
  ... important to vote if you have skin in the game for this API 
  specifically, even if not directly technical
  ... there is also a blog post explaining some of the ins and 
  outs of weighted voting
Mike Prorock:  Clarifying question about "names you definitely 
  don't want"-- that part was a tiny bit confusing
Joe Andrieu: https://www.opavote.com/en/vote/6226340995923968?p=1
Joe Andrieu:  Isn't the second list just the first in reverse?
Manu Sporny:  No, opavote has fancy options
Mike Prorock: Instructions: Use the buttons to add choices to the 
  ballot, and then drag to arrange them in order of preference with 
  your "most disliked" at the top to "moderately disliked" at the 
  bottom
<mprorock> second part of instructions note
Joe Andrieu:  But can't you just fill out the second list as the 
  exact reverse of the first?
Manu Sporny:  Well, most people won't fill out all 17 in both 
  lists... use the second list only for the ones you really DON'T 
  want to see
Manu Sporny:  Polling algorithms are very complicated... opavote 
  let's us change algorithm after the fact, in some cases the lists 
  are mirror opposites, in other cases they're not, we're running 
  two data collection runs in case we pick a tallying mechanism 
  that doesn't produce mirror opposites just to be safe so we don't 
  have to run it all over again.
(Scribe aside: +1 voting math is hard)

Topic: Feature Scoping

Manu Sporny: 
  https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2021Aug/0122.html
<manu> Email that went out to mailing list about this ^^^
<manu> Attempt at summarizing current scope: 
  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hlevKRxCXsJBWvJTkL30nZVp8cpF26aY3PJqzuHtIZE/edit
Manu Sporny:  Email will help focus scope questions, based on 
  various inputs from the group: use cases to date, new diagrams, 
  and resolutions over last few months
  ...screensharing now (spreadsheet from email above)
  ... note link column where more details specs or spec drafts 
  exist
  ... expectation/hope is that discussion and resolutions can 
  decide some of these open questions
Adrian Gropper:  External trust issues
  ... if holder application is external, is the request resulting 
  from the presentation crossing an external boundary?
  ... secondly, are "client credentials" involved in accepting 
  the presentation?
Joe Andrieu:  I'm still confused about the naming, mapping roles 
  and software to the name of the API they use
Manu Sporny:  Issuer may have a verifier backend they use to 
  check or parse a VP...
<dmitriz> I assumed what was meant by Issuer is - if the issuer 
  is hosting a revocation list / bitmap
Joe Andrieu:  But in that case, it's not ACTING AS an issuer, 
  which is exactly my point
  ... about roles and services
  ... being manu: does the changes i'm making on screenshare 
  address that?
(Manu duplicates some rows to create distinctions based on client 
  and server)
Mike Varley:  Issuer deliver credential to holder doesn't seem to 
  be a row here?
  ... am I misreading or did I miss that being put out of scope 
  by the group?
Manu Sporny:  I think you mean rows 9, 10 and/or 11 but i'm not 
  sure
Joe Andrieu:  I doubt it
<tallted> is that Issuance? (first item)
Mike Prorock:  Want to clarify that some of these rows in out of 
  scope divide labor with EDV spec
  ... which is REST-based and get some clarity on how CRUD works 
  there and if this spec should be explicit about what CRUD ops are 
  possible there
Manu Sporny:  That's a good point
  ... of these three scope questions, which would be easiest to 
  address?
  ... for lack on input, i'll address mike prorock's concern 
  first
  ... EDV spec is a good reference for a neutral, open API for 
  storing VCs, doing CRUD on them as objects over REST, etc
Mike Prorock:  GET, PUT, etc are defined there, and we are 
  leaning more towards controller APIs here, so the REST stuff can 
  happen there.... but let's be more explicit
  ... if we are putting it out of scope, we should point them 
  there as a complementary spec for questions devs new to the space 
  will naturally have upon reading this spec
(Manu live-edits the notes column to be more explanatory about 
  the link column as complementary to this being out of scope here)
Joe Andrieu:  It's not clear to me if this a new issue or a 
  non-issue, but what is this presentation service? is that new?
Manu Sporny:  We were talking about a Holder Service, and it was 
  confusing people... note the actions taken in the columns from 
  the holder services above... i tried this neologism to clarify 
  two diff things we've been calling holder services
Joe Andrieu:  But aren't both beholden to the holder? Aren't 
  these transports, not services in rows 9-10-11?
<orie> See the breakdown here: https://gnarly.or13.io/
Orie, q+ plz
<orie> Holder same trust domain vs Holder cross trust domain.
Orie Steele:  I think we should split up APIs that are 
  internal-only from APIs that aren't-- i broke them up in my 
  gnarly prototype/strawman
  ... and i think we should call them exchange, not a service
  ... because it obscures the boundary issues
<mike_varley> "Presentation Service" - is this not a Verifer 
  Service? Or is there no obligation to 'verify' ?
<orie> I called them "Holder" and "Exchange"
<orie> in the proposal above
Joe Andrieu:  I'm down for exchange, or transport, just not 
  service
Adrian Gropper:  External clients necessarily entail client 
  credentials, client censorship, client power relations...
  ... if the request is an API rather than a form after you 
  authenticate, then the API is now external... that's my question
David Chadwick:  I'm going to repeat a comment i made 6 months 
  ago
  ... i still don't really understand the architecture, could we 
  just map the services?
Scribe aside: page 4 here is partial
David Chadwick:  To put it another way, scope might be easier to 
  decide after clarifying architectural assumptions a bit
Mike Prorock: +1
Andrew Rosen:  I want to clarify something about Adrian's 
  question: the subject of a credential isn't the only party that 
  has to authenticate, and non-interactive presentations are in 
  scope, yes?
Many: yes,
Manu Sporny:  Yes, andrew, thanks for clarifying
Manu Sporny:  Returning to adrian's question, I think that many 
  of the rows in the Out-of-scope section are implicating directly 
  in many of the use cases you have brought up; the cruise ship, 
  for example, is mostly about EDV APIs, not the rows9-11 
  (credential exchange) APIs
  ... guardianship and delegation can happen at the 
  holder/access/authZ level, and is better supported there
<tallted> It seems to me that some of this might be made clearer 
  by moving Action to come first.  It would also help to 
  item-number these -- not in priority or action order, per se -- 
  just so we can say things like "API calls 1-7"
  ... rows 9-11 is where we get into more public-facing, 
  client-credential-free APIs
  ... at least, that is one way of further specifying 9-11
Adrian Gropper:  The features out of scope I am not talking about 
  here. What I don't understand is if there is an external request 
  API
Manu Sporny:  Yes, rows 9-11 are EXTERNAL APIs for pull-based or 
  push-based VP flows (no authentication aside from DIDAuth, open 
  APIs)
Adrian Gropper:  So someone brings a request for a VC or VP to 
  those APIs?
Manu Sporny:  Row 9 is for initiating a  flow
Orie Steele:  The current endpoints in trace-vocab  describe a 
  holder asking the verifier for a challenge and domain
  ... i.e., initiating a push-based flow with a verifier that 
  knows you
Mike Prorock: +1 Orie, well stated
  ... what's confusing is that most use-cases we talk about is 
  verifier-centric and pull-based, a verifier advertising an 
  endpoint for holders to bring their credentials to (covid creds 
  or discount coupons)
Ted Thibodeau:  I'm thinking this would be clearer just 
  reordering the columns
Juan Caballero: +1
(Scribe aside^)
Orie Steele: +1 Ted
Ted Thibodeau:  I would also recommend we number/order these a 
  little more deliberately
Joe Andrieu:  We've still not clarified the initiator of various 
  flows, and Orie's explanation surprised me a bit
<orie> please read
Orie Steele: 
  https://github.com/w3c-ccg/vc-http-api/blob/main/holder.yml#L61
  ... Orie's example seemed to describe a valid use case 
  initiated differently than I was assuming
Orie Steele: 
  https://github.com/w3c-ccg/vc-http-api/blob/main/holder.yml#L87
Manu Sporny:  I have to confess that 7&8 have confused me 
  persistently, I look forward to clarifying them
Scribe aside: you are one of us use-case guys, Joe
:D
Joe Andrieu:  Use case guys could really help clarify this
  ...whoever they may be
Adrian Gropper:  I'm still confused
  ... and I already explained what I'm confused about in email, 
  which won't be resolved today
Orie Steele:  Returning to exchange APIs as machine-to-machine 
  services, regulated and acting according to the kinds of patterns 
  they tend to do
  ... in backend-backend data flows, which can be interactive or 
  can be "fire and forget"/firehose-style
  ... two SERVICES that know each other and 
  communicate/sync/replicate according to policies
  ... can use these APIs to do their thing; the push/pull thing 
  maps to two major patterns in how backend-backend flows work 
  generally
Mike Varley:  These ??? service rows (7-8-9 in explicit numbers, 
  9-10-11 in excel row#s)
  ... seems to me an alternative to or equivalent to CHAPI 
  "STORE" calls.  is that accurate?
<orie> its push because it starts with a network request from the 
  prover.
Manu Sporny:  Yes, CHAPI could be used for line 8 (implicit 10), 
  "push-based",
<joe_andrieu> isn't the "prover" the "holder", Orie?
<orie> the word holder is less helpful
<orie> both sides are going to be holders.
<joe_andrieu> perhaps, but it is the term in the VC spec
  ... this row could link to CHAPI if the group found it adequate 
  to the use-cases, or specify/identify something else if not
<orie> the first guy is going to authenticate
<orie> as part of the VP.
<orie> hense push
  ... it's called "start/continue presentation workflow" because 
  it can redirect to a new channel, and can even loop or iterate in 
  generative ways
Orie Steele:  The endpoints and architectural assumptions here 
  are informed by CHAPI precedent and VP Request spec
  ... but pull/push here refers to who initiates and when the 
  challenge/domain happen
Mike Prorock: +1 Definitely right direction
  ... so when a CHAPI website gives a CHAPI wallet a challenge, 
  and gets back a VP signing over that challenge, that's one of the 
  two patterns here, it could be more general but doesn't preclude 
  CHAPI being an adequate way of doing this
Scribe aside: this spreadsheet helps a lot, we use case guys will 
  look at this with or without Joe
Mike Varley: +1 Right direction
<mprorock> this stuff is work in progress that will evolve over 
  time, and this feels much more defined than we have had to date
Manu Sporny:  Use case guys, please email the list with an update 
  or some proposals to clarify or iterate
Manu Sporny:  And that's a wrap
