<justin_richer> Request to the chairs to add an item to the 
  agenda about authorization language.
Justin Richer: :+1:
<michael_herman_(trusted_digital_web)> I might have been firsst
Manu Sporny:  Welcome everyone to the VC HTTP API call, Markus is 
  scribing.. Today on the agenda: [scribe assist by Markus 
  Sabadello]
<justin_richer> 5 min
Manu Sporny:  Agenda review, introductions, request by Justin on 
  authorization language, then presentation by Trinsic with 
  walkthrough of their API [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  At the end of the call, we'll go over the renaming 
  poll results (without making a final decision) [scribe assist by 
  Markus Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  Any updates/changes to the agenda? [scribe assist 
  by Markus Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  Let's do introductions.. Michael? Others? [scribe 
  assist by Markus Sabadello]
Michael Boyd:  I have been in decentralized identity for about 3 
  years, first with Nathan George at Sovrin. Some of us met and 
  founded Trinsic and have been building tools for developers to 
  easily add SSI into their applications. [scribe assist by Markus 
  Sabadello]
Michael Boyd:  I'm an engineer at Trinsic, I like bicyling and 
  cooking. [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  Anyone else? [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Markus Sabadello: Sudesh: I'm from SecureKey, working on 
  Trustbloc and Aries, been working in digital identity for 3 
  years, interested in VC HTTP API, wallets, and Aries protocol.
Markus Sabadello: Rolson_Quadras: Working on HL Aries Framework 
  Go, I've used VC HTTP API, this is my first time in the call.
Justin Richer: 
  https://github.com/w3c-ccg/vc-http-api/compare/main...jricher:security-requirements
Manu Sporny:  Let's get into the agenda, Justin what do you want 
  to talk about? [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]

Topic: Authorization Requirements

Justin Richer:  I dropped a link, I spend some time writing up 
  text on resolutions that were being passed around, and people 
  arguing about what MUST meant. [scribe assist by Markus 
  Sabadello]
Justin Richer:  It's always confusing when there is normative 
  text for spec writers but not implementers [scribe assist by 
  Markus Sabadello]
Justin Richer:  If you read through the text, the top paragraph 
  says since it's an HTTP API, you are allowed to use any 
  technology that can protect such an API. It's recommended to use 
  standard delegation technologies rather than direct 
  authentication. [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Justin Richer:  Every endpoint would define a set of elements 
  that describe the kinds of access. I talked about this when I 
  introduced RAR/GNAP [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Justin Richer:  Neither of those are required to implement or 
  deploy or use. But it says IF you are doing this or that, then 
  you have to support a specific profile. [scribe assist by Markus 
  Sabadello]
Justin Richer:  In addition to text in that branch, I also looked 
  into what it takes to add parameters to endpoint specifications. 
  [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Justin Richer:  It turns out Redoc does not allow for 
  extensibility. [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Justin Richer:  I found no way to put in extensions in the way 
  that OpenAPI allows you to do it. [scribe assist by Markus 
  Sabadello]
Justin Richer:  If the group continues to use Redoc, this will be 
  a limitation [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Justin Richer:  The text tells you, this is the authorization 
  type field, these are the actions and what it means. [scribe 
  assist by Markus Sabadello]
Justin Richer:  This is the full extent that the specification 
  should define, it does not talk about concrete technical details. 
  [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Mike Prorock: NB: Redoc has limitations, there are multiple 
  options for rendering openapi docs
Justin Richer:  I've been arguing that this will really help 
  interoperability [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  Thanks for writing up something concrete that the 
  group can discuss. [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  My expectation is that the group will discuss this 
  [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  We will be picking up the authorization discussion 
  in the future, that should not stop people from talking about it 
  e.g. in Github. [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Justin Richer:  I could turn it into a PR, but hesitated due to 
  discussion [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
<tallted> +1000 -- written text is awesome step in right 
  direction
<mprorock> DRAFT PR might be helpful
Manu Sporny:  It would be helpful if people can comment directly 
  on the lines [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Justin Richer: https://github.com/w3c-ccg/vc-http-api/pull/226
<mprorock> Manu I can run it
Manu Sporny:  Moving on to the next item.. I won't be able to run 
  the call next week. Any volunteers to run the call next week? 
  [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Mike Prorock: +1 Coordination - probably issues and PRs

Topic: Call next week

Justin Richer: @Mprorock: I noticed that. I actually hacked ReDoc 
  to do the display of the additional fields so I know it's at 
  least possible to represent in the data model.

Topic: Trinsic API Presentation

Manu Sporny:  Next topic is Trinsic API presentation. Michael you 
  can screenshare, etc. however you want it. We should timebox 15 
  min, then have Q&A. [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
<mprorock> @Justin yeah, it is pretty slick but requires a bit of 
  hacking for some things
Michael Boyd:  I want to talk about our API and some decisions we 
  have made. [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Michael Boyd:  Trinsic is a developer-focus company that has 
  built a set of APIs and SDKs and a developer dashboard that we 
  call "Credential Studio". People can create organizations that 
  then can operate as Issuers and Verifiers. [scribe assist by 
  Markus Sabadello]
Michael Boyd:  We implement HL Aries .net framework to enable all 
  of this, and we have also built a mobile wallet. [scribe assist 
  by Markus Sabadello]
Michael Boyd:  There is also a Trinsic Wallet API. [scribe assist 
  by Markus Sabadello]
Michael Boyd:  This technoloy enables a really easy way for 
  Issuers, Verifiers and Holders to get up and running with 
  credentials, without any configuration required. [scribe assist 
  by Markus Sabadello]
Michael Boyd:  E.g. I can create a connection invitation and then 
  scan it with a mobile wallet. [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Michael Boyd:  I can create HL Indy credential definitions, on 
  the Sovrin ledger. [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Michael Boyd:  I can create this, then issue it to a wallet. 
  [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Michael Boyd:  The whole interface was completely built using our 
  own public APIs. [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Michael Boyd:  We're happy with our developer documentation. 
  [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Michael Boyd:  In our API, we have three main API concepts. 
  Credential API, Wallet API, and Provider API. [scribe assist by 
  Markus Sabadello]
Michael Boyd:  Connections and credentials we use with 
  organizations are all in the Credentials API. We made it 
  specificially for Issuers and Verifiers. This is probably most 
  aligned with the VC HTTP API. [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Michael Boyd:  For Holders, we defined a Wallet API, which gives 
  you the functionality of a mobile wallet, but in a custodial 
  cloud environment. [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Michael Boyd:  We had a lot of customers requesting this, 
  especially in uses cases where there is no mobile wallet. [scribe 
  assist by Markus Sabadello]
Michael Boyd:  We used this in a project with farmers. [scribe 
  assist by Markus Sabadello]
Michael Boyd:  After working with 100s of developers and 10s of 
  customers going in production, we realized a lot of our customers 
  are "providers" that are helping others onboard into an 
  ecosystem. [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Michael Boyd:  The Provider API allows a company to create 
  organizations en masse, and each organization can have a 
  custodial cloud wallet. [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
<justin_richer> A note for the notes, I updated the PR with 
  screenshots from the hacked version of ReDoc I threw together: 
  https://github.com/w3c-ccg/vc-http-api/pull/226
Michael Boyd:  Using this set of API endpoints, you can create a 
  complete production ecosystem without any configuration needed. 
  [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Michael Boyd:  I wanted to spend time talking about some of our 
  decisions, specifically regarding the Credentials API. [scribe 
  assist by Markus Sabadello]
Michael Boyd:  As I said, we're following the HL Aries protocols 
  and using DIDComm. [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Michael Boyd:  All of our semantics are closely aligned with HL 
  Aries. Most exchanges start with a "connection". This uses Aries 
  connection invitation protocol. [scribe assist by Markus 
  Sabadello]
Michael Boyd:  We found a lot of our customers like the 
  "connections". It abstracts away the credential exchange from 
  their infrastructure. [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Michael Boyd:  We are finding that customers want simple entry 
  points, to make it easy to use. [scribe assist by Markus 
  Sabadello]
Michael Boyd:  In general, as technologists we value flexibility 
  and robustness of features. [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Michael Boyd:  This is also the case for some of our power users. 
  People want "60 minites to Wow". [scribe assist by Markus 
  Sabadello]
<markus_sabadello> s/minites/minutes
Michael Boyd:  I don't know where the VC HTTP API stops in terms 
  of scope, but we found that connections are very valuable. 
  [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Michael Boyd:  We also enabled connection-less credentials, e.g. 
  if organizations want send a QR code via email to send a 
  credential, they could do that as well. [scribe assist by Markus 
  Sabadello]
Michael Boyd:  In our Credentials endpoints, we abstracted a lot 
  of the VC data model away from customers [scribe assist by Markus 
  Sabadello]
Michael Boyd:  We tried to find the right balance between 
  abstraction and original data model. This is very tricky to 
  figure out. [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Michael Boyd:  In our first API, we've chosen to be very 
  "helpful" to our users, we abstract complexity away. [scribe 
  assist by Markus Sabadello]
Michael Boyd:  E.g. we define CRUD endpoints for all credentials, 
  we enable organizations to store all credentials in a cloud 
  wallet. [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Michael Boyd:  We have given users credential IDs to store on 
  their end, if they want to have data self-hosted, they could 
  choose to store all credentials in their own environment and 
  delete them from the Trinsic backend. [scribe assist by Markus 
  Sabadello]
Michael Boyd:  We chose to make things easy to use and abstracted 
  [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
<manu_sporny> mprorock, I see you... holding until 15 minutes is 
  up and then I'll see if Michael wants to take questions.
Mike Prorock: +1 Manu - it is an if we have time
Michael Boyd:  E.g. for an offer, you supply a credential 
  definition. You can create that and then offering a credential is 
  as simple as putting a credential ID and connection ID, and then 
  adding the values. [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Michael Boyd:  All values are text type, we don't have specific 
  field types at this point. [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Michael Boyd:  For the audience here, let's make this based on 
  questions. I'm also interested in what areas others find most 
  interesting, then let's have a discussion on shared learnings to 
  build better APIs. [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  This sounds great. Let's use our queuing system. 
  Anyone who wants to ask questions, please add youself to the 
  queue. [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Mike Prorock:  I'm also super impressed by this. We've done 
  similar abstraction in our products to make it easy to onboard. 
  [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Michael Boyd:  Noone has asking for this [low-level access to 
  semantics?], it wouldn't be complex to implement, but our 
  organization users haven't really found this valuable yet. 
  [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Michael Boyd:  Your users should be able to export and import 
  credentials, to avoid vendor lock-in [scribe assist by Markus 
  Sabadello]
Michael Boyd:  HL Aries/indy stack don't really use the VC data 
  model behind the scenes. They don't use contexts and linked data. 
  [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Markus Sabadello: Michael_Herman: I'm a client and developer 
  using the Trinsic API, and it's easy to use.
Markus Sabadello: Michael_Herman: If every store wanted to be 
  enabled to do purchase orders and invoices, how would this scale 
  to be pervasive across the work?
Markus Sabadello: Michael_Herman: Does everybody have to become 
  an Issuer?
<justin_richer> . o O ( My Cabbages! )
Markus Sabadello: Michael_Herman: If one store wants to send a 
  purchase order to another store, do they have to become an 
  Issuer? How do we make this scale for everyday business 
  transactions?
Michael Boyd:  It's useful to build the piping, the roads of an 
  infrastructure, then let industry partners go and help provider 
  more of a frontend experience to customers. [scribe assist by 
  Markus Sabadello]
Michael Boyd:  Would a grocery store have to be an Issuer? 
  Depends, answer is probably yes, but they would probably be 
  dealing with some frontend vendor software rather than VC data 
  model directly. [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Michael Boyd:  I forsee APIs such as ours to be integrated with 
  other systems across the world. This is why we mentioned the 
  "Provider" concept. The majority of our customers want to "own" 
  the experience, we're giving them the tools to suceed. [scribe 
  assist by Markus Sabadello]
Markus Sabadello: Michael_Herman: I imagine add-ons to existing 
  software that can issue VCs
Adrian Gropper:  You mentioned messaging-oriented design with 
  credentials going through DIDComm or email [scribe assist by 
  Markus Sabadello]
Adrian Gropper:  Is there any authorization component in your 
  stack (Studio), or are you assuming there will be a frontend that 
  might or might not have authorization. When you do it the way you 
  did, does it matter to the Issuer whether they talk to the Holder 
  of the Verifier? [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Adrian Gropper:  If it's messaging-oriented, I imaging it makes 
  no difference if they communicate with Holder or Verifier. 
  [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Michael Boyd:  Talking to you about authorization is a pleasure 
  [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Michael Boyd:  We use bearer tokens for each organization as 
  authorization. [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Michael Boyd:  For Aries/DIDComm that is done behind the scenes. 
  We are talking about authorization to the API itself, and beyond 
  that is DIDComm with mutually authenticated connections. [scribe 
  assist by Markus Sabadello]
Mike Prorock: +1 This is very standard for auth approach for api 
  services
Michael Boyd:  Our bearer tokens are using our own identity 
  provider endpoint. [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Michael Boyd:  We are looking at ZCAP-LD for future 
  implementations of our API; at this point though it's just the 
  bearer token itself that enables a client or server-side caller 
  to authenticate to our API [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Michael Boyd:  The same goes for verifying a credential; they 
  will authenticate with bearer token and then use the API 
  endpoints. [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Michael Boyd:  For the Holder, that is completely done using 
  DIDComm. The wallet is standalone, no dependency on our backend 
  services. They have a push notification service behind the 
  scenes. [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Michael Boyd:  Those are authenticated in headers at the 
  endpoints. [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
<mprorock> "active"
Manu Sporny:  Michael, there has been a heated discussion on 
  authorization. I'm wondering if what Michael said is acceptable 
  to you agropper, or if you are still concerned about sovereignty. 
  [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Adrian Gropper:  I'm entirely focused on the ability of the 
  subject to delegate. [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Adrian Gropper:  To the extent that Trinsic Studio doesn't force 
  subjects to be holders, I'm completely aligned with that. [scribe 
  assist by Markus Sabadello]
Adrian Gropper:  In what I am proposing, I want to separate 
  posession from control, and allow for delegation of the control 
  component. [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Adrian Gropper:  The right to delegate as a human right is what 
  ties together my insistence. [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Adrian Hope-Bailie:  Then why are you pushing back on VC-HTTP-API 
  which has the exact same system to system needs as we see here 
  [scribe assist by Mike Prorock]
Joe Andrieu: +1 Organizations are not people
Michael Boyd:  We've taked an approach of "organizations are not 
  people", this has helped us move forward. Issuers and verifiers 
  are different enties than Holders. [scribe assist by Markus 
  Sabadello]
Michael Boyd:  With the Wallet API, this is a custodial 
  relationship under an organization. An organization can have many 
  wallets. [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
<manu_sporny> Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission 
  would like to have a few words with you, Joe. :P
<mprorock> lol
Michael Boyd:  For farmers authentication/authorization in one 
  part of the world is probably not the same as for me in a 
  different part of the world. [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  My question is about coordinating. Michael you 
  asked how can we learn from each others. [scribe assist by Markus 
  Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  In the Trinsic API, there are some endpoints that 
  seem to map cleanly to VC HTTP API endpoints [scribe assist by 
  Markus Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  The other discussion is about authorization. I 
  think I heard you say you use bearer tokens for all endpoints 
  module the wallet holder DIDComm part [scribe assist by Markus 
  Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  Is is OAuth2 client credentials, is it some kind of 
  OIDC based flow to the the bearer token? [scribe assist by Markus 
  Sabadello]
<mprorock> are you using auth0 or okta?
Michael Boyd:  I believe they are just client credentials, signed 
  tokens that have an expiration date of I think one year; they are 
  stored in a secure location and sent alongside the request. I 
  don't think it's OIDC. [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
<justin_richer> one year token expiration? 🤯
Manu Sporny:  The other question is maybe more important. I think 
  I heard you say you focus on a simple, holistic product. [scribe 
  assist by Markus Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  Is there any interest in Trinsic v2 API to align 
  with VC HTTP API, or do you first focus on your customers and 
  it's not necessarily a goal to align? [scribe assist by Markus 
  Sabadello]
Michael Boyd:  I'm interested in understanding the specific use 
  cases, I didn't explore that before the call. I'd like Issuers 
  and Verifiers to use open-source and use different vendors. 
  [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Michael Boyd:  We'll likely see a dual approach where you can 
  have an endpoint to issue a credential that is very abstracted 
  [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Michael Boyd:  We're separating "Trinsic Core" and "Trinsic 
  Ecosystems". Latter is a platform, former is a set of tools 
  [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Michael Boyd:  We'll use the standardized specifications in our 
  core side, and then we'll support more application-specific 
  scenarios. [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Michael Boyd:  Yes we want to standardize and align with people, 
  but we will have ecosystems products on top of that. [scribe 
  assist by Markus Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  Interesting how you've broken up the APIs into 
  those two groups. The Providers API seem really interesting. 
  [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  Do you have any thoughts on which parts of those 
  need to be standardized, and which parts don't? Maybe the 
  ecosystems layer is value-add where vendors compete? The other 
  approach is standardize everything [scribe assist by Markus 
  Sabadello]
Michael Boyd:  I resonate more with the first approach. I think 
  having good tooling is a value-add for developers [scribe assist 
  by Markus Sabadello]
Michael Boyd:  With great tooling we achieve great adoption. 
  [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
<mprorock> default expire for a new provider key i am creating 
  now was set to "08/24/2024"
Michael Boyd:  Tools that actually work and are easy to use. I'm 
  thinking about how Docker gained such a following (largely due to 
  tools) [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Michael Boyd:  Trinsic and others can then provide more of a 
  platform, analogous to DockerHub [scribe assist by Markus 
  Sabadello]
Michael Boyd:  Do we want people to be locked in? No. But we do 
  want to achieve real-world adoption, for that we need a healthy 
  ecosystem of vendors to serve customers. [scribe assist by Markus 
  Sabadello]
Michael Boyd:  I like to solve customer products on a broad scale 
  with products. [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Michael Boyd:  So I see this as a two-tiered approach [scribe 
  assist by Markus Sabadello]
<mprorock> this was great!
<juan_caballero_(spruce)> thanks michael! this was great!
<michael_herman_(trusted_digital_web)> +1000
Manu Sporny:  This is an example of really great API 
  documentation. Thank you for coming, hopefully we will see more 
  from Trinsic in the coming years. [scribe assist by Markus 
  Sabadello]
Michael Boyd:  I would love to learn from everyone here, and I 
  hope we can learn from each other. michael@trinsic.id feel free 
  to reach out. [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]

Topic: VC HTTP API Renaming Poll Results

<manu_sporny> Poll results are here: 
  https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2021Aug/0297.html
Manu Sporny:  We sent a pool to the community to get some 
  thoughts on what the name could be. [scribe assist by Markus 
  Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  We have one objection on the poll, which means the 
  editors will have to make a call, or the chairs and the CCG will 
  have to make a call there. [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  But today we can go through the results so far 
  [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  We went out to the community and asked what they 
  wanted to rename the API to. There was good discussion on 
  branding/marketing, with a number of suggestions on what we could 
  do. [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  I'll share my secreen [scribe assist by Markus 
  Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  26 People voted in the poll. [scribe assist by 
  Markus Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  Top picks were VC-API, VCX, VC HAPI [scribe assist 
  by Markus Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  Most disliked names were also voted on. [scribe 
  assist by Markus Sabadello]
<justin_richer> three cheers for Veri McCredentialFace
Manu Sporny:  We used the Borda Count method (this is used 
  whenever people are trying to pick their favorite option) [scribe 
  assist by Markus Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  Pretty strong support for 3-5 items here, rest of 
  them didn't get much support [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  It was good to get that data. The data has been 
  uploaded to the mailing list. People can check the raw data. 
  [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  Any thoughts on this? Surprises on what ended up 
  being ranked highly, or anything interesting about the results? 
  [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  I'm interested in how "VC API" got the highest 
  results. [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  I was expecting other things that are more 
  descriptive. [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
<justin_richer> fwiw this is not a transport protocol: "transport 
  protocol" means something very specific in the networking world
Mike Prorock:  Sad that Veri McCredentialFace is not on top :) 
  [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Mike Prorock:  Interesting to have this non-binding poll, it's 
  really useful feedback. [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Mike Prorock:  Having 26 votes is quite in line with active 
  engagement numbers in the community. [scribe assist by Markus 
  Sabadello]
Mike Prorock:  At the same time, VC API it does seem a bit 
  descriptive, it does seem to kind of make sense. I wasn't sure 
  how the "transport"ly names would do. [scribe assist by Markus 
  Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  Any last minute thoughts? [scribe assist by Markus 
  Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  Thank you everyone, thank you Markus for scribing 
  and Michael for presenting Trinsic API. [scribe assist by Markus 
  Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  Next week mprorock will be running the call. 
  [scribe assist by Markus Sabadello]
Manu Sporny:  Have a wonderful rest of the week, bye [scribe
