Topic: Introductions & Reintroductions\

<kerri_lemoie> Welcome @Dave!\
Dave_Montorio_-_WeSchool: Yeah nice to meet you everyone I'm Dave 
  Mario I'm an engineering leader in high school and we School 
  we're exploring some development of some feature on the Republic 
  learn Social Web free blockchain and identity so I'm very happy 
  to join your your meeting today.\

Topic: Announcements & Reminders\

<kerri_lemoie> Go UNC Lady Tarheels!\

Topic: Main Topic - LearnCard Alpha Leak with Learning Economy Foundation\

Cherie Duncan:  I think Cox here with Learning Academy Foundation 
  so thanks for letting us present today about learning card I am 
  going to see my screen okay.\
<kaliya> Weird I am calling jn via tbe app and j cant hear any 
  ome talk\
<kaliya> But j can hear noises from JItsi\
Cherie Duncan:  Okay perfect great so I'll just hop in a little 
  bit and I'll try and kind of fly through it to leave room for 
  questions and kind of discussion because I think you know for a 
  lot of us are made you finding learn card in a way that's the 
  little for the broader Community right so yeah I'll I'll get 
  started.\
<kerri_lemoie> @kaliya - weird jitsi app issue?\
Cherie Duncan:  In a ruthless and I think a lot of you understand 
  what learning is right but I like to ask this question because it 
  helped rain kind of why things like verify credentials are useful 
  and so you know sort of a leading question was earning I found a 
  definition that.\
<simone_ravaioli> anyone else calling in from the Jisti App ?\
Cherie Duncan:  Broad it's a process that leads to change as a 
  result of experience and so as a result you're learning 
  experiences then become a vital part of your personal and 
  professional reputation and so consequently where does learn 
  happen effectively anywhere from conferences to books to 
  playgrounds to video games too you know working calls like this 
  one and.\
Cherie Duncan:   How do we capture.\
Cherie Duncan:  Apis and this is I think where let me come you 
  foundation and card is really trying to solve a lot of the 
  problems that exist in the current you know education and 
  credentialing systems with our you know if you if you look at 
  this diagram for a lot of folks L2 and L1 mean things but you 
  know we like to.\
Cherie Duncan:   To think of this L ER.\
Cherie Duncan:  His been three layers layer 0 is the the 
  standards like the seats and More in layer 1 is those core 
  utilities like wallet what's lady who ends up being the impact 
  and so we like to work on layer 0 and layer one because you know 
  those are how we ensure energy and you know transferability 
  between.\
Cherie Duncan:   Institutions for learners.\
Cherie Duncan:  I'm in we allow for Learners or for instance are 
  actually providing credentialing to focus on the impact like 
  providing learning and job opportunities and applications built 
  on top of digital wallets.\
Cherie Duncan:  That's why we have learned card which I'm I know 
  many of you have had the opportunity to check it out and hear 
  about learn card and today Beyond just the you know the digital 
  wallet portions we have some new features that we are launching 
  very very soon that are part of the free open-source toolkit that 
  learn card provides.\
Cherie Duncan:   It's so for folks who don't.\
Cherie Duncan:  Know what Lan card is learn card is a digital 
  wallet that is free open source and it's both an application on 
  the App Store and in a web app and an open source SDK for issuing 
  learning storing and sharing verifiable credentials so learn card 
  itself this is kind of what the app looks like everything within 
  learn card is.\
Cherie Duncan:   Part of.\
Cherie Duncan:  SDK so all of these UI elements you see here are 
  your you can redeploy them on your own version of learn card yeah 
  we've got it on the App Store and what not and yeah I'm gonna hop 
  in actually really quick into sort of actual deployments of learn 
  card and then break down a bit of the technical back-end to you 
  know talk a little bit about how we've designed it and our.\
Cherie Duncan:   Plug-in based.\
<kaliya> I give up. Cant hear anyone.\
Cherie Duncan:  I'm first just some deployment of learn card so 
  met adversity is a partnership with or it's a platform for D 
  institutionalizing learner data and allowing Learners to carry 
  their student ID their course catalog and earn skills wherever 
  they go throughout their post-secondary learning experiences and 
  throughout the metaphors.\
Cherie Duncan:   City app learners.\
<simone_ravaioli> so sorry Kaliya !\
Cherie Duncan:  Explore courses map their learning Journeys 
  through met adversity while working these sort of in-demand 
  skills from local employers so we're working with motlow State 
  community colleges in Tennessee with their mechatronics and 
  distillers programs to issue you know verifiable credentials for 
  Learners who complete Community College courses in those relevant 
  with those relevant skills and then they can go directly to 
  employers with those skills in.\
Cherie Duncan:   Digital wallet.\
<pl/t3_asu> Had that problem too Simone (no audio) had to switch 
  browsers.\
Cherie Duncan:  And so yeah met adversity is one example of how 
  we're deploying learn card so the the verifiable credential or 
  everything is powered by verifiable credentials and it's built on 
  top of this learner wallet.\
<dmitri_zagidulin> @Kaliya - yeah, try switching browsers (and 
  don't use the mobile app)\
Cherie Duncan:  The other application is called super skills it's 
  a partnership with the Lego foundation and it takes real world 
  play activities like designing a paper playing and making 
  modifications to it and these activities are derived designed 
  around holistic skills like creativity and social and emotional 
  skills physical skills cognitive skills and then the Learners 
  themselves capture metadata about their activities taking 
  pictures and answering questions and.\
Cherie Duncan:   As a result.\
<simone_ravaioli> is anyone else having the audio problem that 
  Kalya and Phil had ?\
Cherie Duncan:  Verifiable credentials to them with those 
  holistic skills so the the Young Learners can choose their own 
  characters you know they can there's kind of a fun superhero 
  story that the the Learners go through they play the activities 
  and they build Creations to help you know the other girls in the 
  realm and yeah at the end they're issued verifiable credentials 
  with you know the associated holistic skills.\
Cherie Duncan:   That they developed.\
Cherie Duncan:  Variants so we're really excited about this 
  because we did you know partnership with Legal Foundation and an 
  organization called BrainPOP and actually you know have a 
  research paper and have actually proven the model of super scales 
  for Creative subscale development which is I think pretty 
  exciting obviously you know we need to replicate and expand 
  Beyond The Core group of.\
Cherie Duncan:   Where he's at.\
Cherie Duncan:  But it's a really good start to providing Young 
  Learners with sort of self Sovereign you know portable 
  credentials capturing the experiences so let's see yeah dids and 
  how we're using him this is I think really the some of the 
  coolest stuff that we're doing card and what makes I think this.\
Cherie Duncan:   A really useful.\
Cherie Duncan:  For anyone who wants to you know deploy a 
  verifiable credential wallet so we do a plug-in based 
  architecture here everything from Storage to you know 
  microservices to you know your did methods everything is plug-in 
  based so we use ipfs via ceramic to Pink encrypted credentials to 
  ipfs.\
Cherie Duncan:   Yes but.\
Cherie Duncan:  It's actually storage and blockchain agnostic so 
  for example we're talking about doing a deployment in some school 
  systems and they want to have control of the learner data or like 
  like a custody of the learner data and so they would prefer to do 
  it on a Microsoft Azure server and that's totally possible but 
  anything on chain off chain device storage Google Drive 
  decentralized webnode whatever can be a.\
<taylor_(lef)> SuperSkills research report - 
  https://www.dropbox.com/s/exhekb6lk3jwn5e/SuperSkills%20BETA%20research%20report.pdf?dl=0\
Cherie Duncan:  You know mechanism we use did kit for as a 
  plug-in and it's our preferred way to leverage dids and VC's but 
  again it's not the only way to do it and so you know all of these 
  one of the reasons we leverage did kit and ipfs in particular is 
  that you know if we use these plugins learn card ends up becoming 
  perp.\
Cherie Duncan:   Fully non-custodial.\
Cherie Duncan:  So when you know in a sort of default deployment 
  of learned your private key pair is generated on demand and use 
  you know familiar web to on-ramps Allah web 3 auth to use like 
  you know your Gmail or your Discord account or phone number to 
  access your.\
Cherie Duncan:  But the private key never actually and so 
  generating this your dad from private Keys decrypting your 
  credentials everything all happens directly from your user device 
  and we spent a lot of effort to make that happen because we 
  believe that being non-custodial and you know allowing Learners 
  to be self Sovereign and have control over their data and who 
  sees it is really important so new features.\
Cherie Duncan:  In this is all part of the open-source toolkit so 
  anyone who wants to deploy anything like this is totally free to 
  do so and so we'll just keep you updated as you know these 
  features roll out in the next oh gosh probably week or so but our 
  network is a set of completely did authenticated features for 
  peer-to-peer credential issuance so you see here we've got social 
  badges.\
Cherie Duncan:   And various different types of credentials 
  within the learner.\
<simone_ravaioli> www.learncard.com\
Cherie Duncan:  This is all powered by a set of features called 
  boost boost is kind of the way that you are able to issue 
  credentials within learn card app to peers or even you know to 
  for self attestation to yourself or to students so imagine a 
  teacher the contact list of their 30 or so students and batch 
  issuing attendance credential or your activity completion.\
Cherie Duncan:   Has to Learners using something like boost.\
Cherie Duncan:  You can boost things like social badges 
  achievements courses jobs IDs all into boost and so long as it 
  has a digital wallet with a did you can issue a VC into them and 
  yeah learn Cartoon Network is not just a set of features for 
  peer-to-peer you know did too did credential issuance but it can 
  actually support did based entities and applications to.\
Cherie Duncan:   Oh bi-directionally share credentials.\
Cherie Duncan:  Like smart resume we have.\
Cherie Duncan:  With we're smart resume can read critically.\
Cherie Duncan:  Your learn card and you know.\
Cherie Duncan:  As me and likewise learn card can read smart 
  resume and create credentials within your line card and so we are 
  hoping to really you know open up this app sort of marketplace 
  because or I guess ecosystem is a better better tool because it's 
  you know you don't have to pay anything for it but the 
  applications you know we really.\
Cherie Duncan:   To expand because as long as.\
Cherie Duncan:  Um you know a place to store your VCS learn card 
  can issue to them right so we don't necessarily care who you are 
  or what application you're using as long as you can resolve a VC 
  then you can take advantage of getting credentials from learn 
  card or you know reading your credentials from learn card or any 
  of these various applications exist in our application 
  Marketplace so yeah that is my.\
Cherie Duncan:   My you know super quick run-through.\
<pl/t3_asu> Is the exchange of credentials mediated by VPs?\
Cherie Duncan:  And learn card in a bunch of the new features I'm 
  going to exit out really quick and stop sharing my screen does 
  anyone have any questions Simona I don't know how much time I 
  have so I don't want to take up too much or not enough so.\
PL/T3_ASU: I'll give it a try do you hear me yeah excellent so 
  thank you Duncan I just asked in the chat this if the exchange of 
  credentials is mediated by verifiable presentations or or what 
  are the methods by which you do that.\
Cherie Duncan:  Yeah so we actually have a set of tools for.\
Cherie Duncan:  Bring a verifiable position and it's like a in 
  locked verifiable presentation where you could you know create 
  one with a subset of your credentials and then share it with 
  potential employer and or whoever you'd like are you talking for 
  example between like did based entities or between like for 
  employee or.\
PL/T3_ASU: I'm actually it's an open question at the question 
  there's two parts to it I guess one is the protocol that you're 
  using for doing that it appears is that you're using VC API but 
  and not did come or or or or others and the second was the 
  potential endpoints both receiving from an issuer as well as.\
PL/T3_ASU:  sending to a third party.\
Cherie Duncan:  Yeah the the so we actually support a bunch of 
  Standards so CCAP I did come V2 a bunch of have a huge list here 
  but so it's yeah we've got it we've got it configured so you know 
  you can kind of choose your method but I am sorry what was the 
  second part.\
Cherie Duncan:   Of your question.\
PL/T3_ASU: Well just to finish up that first part when I download 
  the app from the App Store what is it expecting to use or what by 
  default what is it using.\
Cherie Duncan:  Yeah it's using this API.\
PL/T3_ASU: Okay okay that's just that that's one thing and the 
  other question I was asking about was just the different 
  protocols that you've implemented and if you want to use those I 
  assume you're going to have to do some some editing of the actual 
  application.\
Cherie Duncan:  Yeah so the if you want to use them in your own 
  deployment we have fairly easy CLI that you can use to kind of 
  fiddle around with those settings so.\
PL/T3_ASU: Okay thank you.\
Kerri Lemoie:  All right thanks.\
Kerri Lemoie:  One thing I you brought up is important is the 
  concept of non-custodial versus custodial wallets and I think 
  some folks on this call may not have an understanding of what 
  that means and also what the implications are for that so I was 
  wondering if you wouldn't mind doing like a quick little contrast 
  and comparison for us with that in mind.\
Cherie Duncan:  Yeah yeah no absolutely thank you thank you for 
  asking you this is I think my favorite thing about my card so you 
  know.\
Cherie Duncan:   We've designed.\
Cherie Duncan:  Card in such a way that.\
<pl/t3_asu> another question: is self-issuing supported?\
<simone_ravaioli> This is the Technical Deck of Learning Economy 
  Protocol - 
  https://www.dropbox.com/s/btri08xlx7ppsyp/Learning%20Economy%20Technical%20Frameworks%20%28P%29.pdf?dl=0\
Cherie Duncan:  Every every way or every stop along the way a 
  learner is entirely in control of their own data their own 
  identity information everything and learn card doesn't act as any 
  sort of centrally to her Central Authority in managing any 
  personal or private data and we achieve this in a number of ways 
  so first off our sign on mechanism we use a set of tools called 
  Web 3 off.\
Cherie Duncan:   With is a.\
Cherie Duncan:  Key management or set of key engagement tools 
  that any privacy-preserving way allows you to use existing 
  identity anchors like email cell phone this court account Etc any 
  any single sign-on system whatever it's in totally configurable 
  to sign into web relocations and so what this means is that you 
  know no one organization is necessarily getting access to either 
  private key.\
Cherie Duncan:   He's or identity.\
Cherie Duncan:  For people who are signing in using web 3i so 
  that's that's the first component right is we're not really 
  capturing signing info the second component is the the credential 
  storage itself right so we use by default credentials live on 
  your device in your digital wallet they are backed up using ipfs 
  and ceramic and for those who were not familiar ipfs in Saran 
  short ipfs is like you know.\
Cherie Duncan:   Sort of sort of like BitTorrent web.\
<simone_ravaioli> IPFS is decentralised storage\
Kerri Lemoie: https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/what-is-ipfs/\
Cherie Duncan:  Where it breaks up data into a bunch of little 
  pieces and stores them on hosts or the internet and then you can 
  Retreat bit by bit and you know kind of reconstruct the 
  information that's been stored there but you know I think for a 
  lot of stuff on ipfs it's just publicly available and viewable 
  but we do in crypt the Critter on ipfs using the wallet holders.\
Cherie Duncan:   Private key and.\
<simone_ravaioli> About Ceramic- https://ceramic.network/\
Cherie Duncan:  Only way to decrypt and view the credential that 
  start on ipfs is with the people as long as you don't share your 
  private key with anybody you are the only person who can view 
  that credential let's start on ipfs what this means right is that 
  as long as you have an internet connection in some way to access 
  your private key so any one of your various identity that use 
  with web free web three off you can actually restore your learn 
  car in all of.\
Cherie Duncan:   Of your credentials\ to your learn card wallet 
  so imagine.\
Kerri Lemoie: https://blog.ceramic.network/what-is-ceramic/\
Cherie Duncan:  You know goes across borders and listening to 
  their devices because of economic turmoil or civil unrest right 
  as long as they have access to their Gmail account right or 
  whatever account they had right back in there there how they 
  could restore all of their credentials just like they were before 
  and they would be the only person who could do so and so again we 
  don't read any of the data that happens in a learner wallet in 
  order to share the data you need to give permission to entities.\
Cherie Duncan:   That are wanting.\
Cherie Duncan:  Accent and so.\
Cherie Duncan:  Yeah at the right this non-custodial the opposite 
  would.\
Cherie Duncan:  We be you know a single issuing authority would 
  handle all the sign in so they didn't signing into a Google 
  account and then Google was like oh yeah you know inside in and 
  here's all of his credentials I can view and my you know 
  utilities control who he shares it with and how he shares it and 
  I view all of his sharing just like traditional web two ways of 
  handling things where you know we're not really in control of who 
  views are data and how they.\
Cherie Duncan:   How they use it so.\
Cherie Duncan:  Does that does that work carry.\
Kerri Lemoie:  Oh yeah thank you next second I'm sure other 
  people might have some follow-up questions in the chat probably 
  of testimony.\
Cherie Duncan:  Yes yeah so we have a whole set of tools for kind 
  of satisfaction of credentials and yeah you can you can issue any 
  of the existing credentials yourself and what we're hoping to do 
  right is provide some tools and features to help make that you 
  know kind of legitimize that experience and you know with our 
  various Integrations with different applications that can issue 
  be seized.\
Cherie Duncan:   He's we hope to you know.\
Cherie Duncan:  Get more meaningful to issue credentials to 
  yourself that makes sense because you know right now it's just 
  like a resume or whatever where they have to trust with all the 
  info you put in there so.\
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Thanks yeah well thank you so much by the way 
  for this presentation this is wonderful I want to ask if learn 
  card had any roadmap intentions to offer storage aside for my BFS 
  because right like even with encryption through ceramic it's 
  still being stored on on other people's computers essentially 
  it's on the pub and as we all know.\
Dmitri Zagidulin:   Encryption has Half-Life and so.\
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Had alternatives to that and same question for 
  the web three off so the moment I can't use the wallet without 
  creating web three off account and I was wondering if you had any 
  road map options to provide alternatives to that thanks.\
Cherie Duncan:  Yeah so in our kind of default app available on 
  the App Store in the web I don't know if we have any plans to 
  change from those I think we're you know we're fairly new as a 
  Canseco have them you know we'll stick with.\
Cherie Duncan:   Three often in sir.\
Cherie Duncan:  But in terms of the open source SDK and toolkit 
  you can use anything for storage right and so you know as we 
  develop those different plugins or as the community to plugins 
  this is the thing right is that you know as a community we would 
  love for folks to develop that use utilities that you find useful 
  right to interact with this ecosystem or to partner with other 
  folks who.\
Cherie Duncan:   It provides you know did based tools to you know 
  integrate with their their products or.\
Cherie Duncan:  Services but um anyway all that to say is that 
  it's not.\
Cherie Duncan:  Totally unheard of that we might you know provide 
  alternatives to the sign on methods because I definitely do here 
  you encryption does have a half half life and we have to stay on 
  top of it if we're going to make sure that you know privacy is 
  actually preserved so.\
Cherie Duncan:  Yeah that's a good question so we are working on 
  it tirelessly to make sure we get it right it was you know 
  scheduled to come out a couple weeks ago but we you know I think 
  we're word letting it percolate for a little bit so we can get it 
  right but it should be coming out any moment now you know we've 
  been chomping at the bit for.\
Cherie Duncan:   It's o.\
Cherie Duncan:  And actually let me let me share learn card 
  GitHub repo because that might be relevant to people.\
Cherie Duncan: https://github.com/learningeconomy/LearnCard\
<taylor_(lef)> Boost will definitely be available prior to 
  ASU-GSV.\
PL/T3_ASU: Well I mean the short answer is I think it's 
  absolutely essential because without it those people that don't 
  have issued credentials from some into third party entity can't 
  express themselves in the same currency and language that that 
  credentials are being sent all understand it's understood that 
  their credentials signed by themselves are in.\
PL/T3_ASU: Ready corroboration and clearly there needs to be 
  mechanisms to do that some of which have been have been already 
  proposed and written up such as such as using a third-party 
  credential as a as a recommendation to the one that the person 
  self issued but without it we leaving out a huge section of 
  potential Workforce thanks.\
<duncan_cox> @Phil to your question earlier, we also package up 
  and expose CHAPI to folks who want to use LearnCard to build a 
  CHAPI compliant application. Love CHAPI!\
<dmitri_zagidulin> heh, what software ever stays lean? :)\
Xander_-_ASU/Pocket: Oh yeah thanks well I think playing doubles 
  on the kid is certainly Mighty my role often within the pocket 
  team so I'm happy to wear the horns today as well you know I 
  think this is a big Challenge and I think there are other aspects 
  of you know to learn card solution that are kind of in the same 
  vein of trust is often assumed when we talk about technological 
  solutions in this space but that's not a trivial thing so the 
  more you democratize the ability to issue.\
Xander_-_ASU/Pocket:  credentials the harder it is to maintain 
  Trust.\
Xander_-_ASU/Pocket: Like what stops me from cleverly 
  impersonating someone building up an online you know kind of 
  identity that is very similar to a different trusted party it 
  really opens the door to a lot of abuse so I think the mechanisms 
  for building trust inside and outside of this technical solution 
  is underdeveloped relative to the capabilities of the tools and 
  so I think that's a big challenge you know even something like 
  what.\
Xander_-_ASU/Pocket:  this is a question I was.\
Xander_-_ASU/Pocket: Were incurred as well but I don't want to 
  split the topic here too much I saw someone maybe wants to 
  respond some of y'all stop here and let them do that.\
Kerri Lemoie:  Yeah I hear is enter saying and I agree and I 
  think part of it is because in a large part of digital literacy 
  isn't isn't great right people don't really understand how the 
  web works now and what risks there are and to some extent I don't 
  know that they will really ever understand why any of this is any 
  better which is kind of like disheartening to say I mean I'm 
  somebody who's been working in this space for a.\
Kerri Lemoie:   Long time my my PhD is in.\
Kerri Lemoie:  And technology and that's what I really think we 
  need to work towards but to an extent I think we need to get 
  technologists on board to implement their apps using this 
  technology more and more so that it just becomes an inherent part 
  of what the web is and that's where our audience really is I 
  think for this technology is how do we make it easy to develop 
  with this technology and put it in place that it's a no-brainer 
  and it just becomes the backbone of the internet and um it just 
  works right.\
Kerri Lemoie:   And I think that's what we could do as 
  technologists in the space to help with the trust aspect.\
PL/T3_ASU: Sure I just want to on the one hand plus one would 
  carry was just saying about the need to be clear about our 
  definitions and what their implications of what the implications 
  of them are I still hear people talking about verification as if 
  there's some sort of Authority or equivalent to Quality Assurance 
  behind something that's been signed as opposed to Simply.\
PL/T3_ASU:  that it's tamper evident and.\
PL/T3_ASU: Have that clear that clarification well understood 
  across the community but beyond that I mean what it's what it's 
  simple we need to get past the notion of brand recognition as the 
  proxy of trust and we already know from the reports that the last 
  mile DCC report has shown and and worked from Sean Gallagher up 
  at Northeastern that that there isn't a lot of business 
  interests.\
PL/T3_ASU:  it's in verification.\
PL/T3_ASU: Because they don't see.\
<simone_ravaioli> Last Mile report by MIT DCC - 
  https://news.mit.edu/2022/last-mile-credentials-employment-1103\
PL/T3_ASU: Distinction between that and brand and since they 
  don't have brand recognition of an individual a sign credential 
  from an individual doesn't mean a whole lot to them and in that 
  sense they're probably right other than it is a signed and 
  traceable recognition or credential that the identity of the 
  signer is at least consistent to that particular did but other 
  than that it's not all that useful.\
PL/T3_ASU:  useful what's more.\
PL/T3_ASU: Are useful is implementing the human-oriented trust 
  mechanisms that we are talking about with respect to trust 
  Registries and and recommendations and things like that to be 
  able to move to the next step thanks.\
Cherie Duncan:  Well maybe a return back to the you know.\
Cherie Duncan:  She'll question about is from a wallet one of the 
  things that we've had some conversations with about our about in 
  recently is a sort of emergent situations so not to say that 
  something like learn card is the only solution or best solution 
  right but imagine you know in the recent earthquake crisis in 
  Turkey you have emergent skills that need to be learned today 
  like I.\
Cherie Duncan:   Can enter an IV or I.\
Cherie Duncan:  In a play.\
Cherie Duncan:  Make it or a can you know do CPR imagine if you 
  have you know people on the Fly educating people within this 
  context around these emergent skills that need to be learned 
  today and then you could show up to disaster situation and say 
  like hit I actually know how to administer a tourniquet here's my 
  credential or in a context land really rural schools that don't 
  have tons of.\
Cherie Duncan:   Of you know existing Tech in.\
Cherie Duncan:  Structure is long as Learners have devices which 
  you know a huge percentage of Learners in low and middle income 
  countries have devices but they might not have computers and 
  their G i-- teacher could actually create a learning system 
  around just device for Learners and so again not to say the learn 
  card is the ideal solution for this but it does empower some sort 
  of like decentralized learning system.\
Cherie Duncan:   Seems that might not be possible.\
Cherie Duncan:  This sort of device to an officer while it 
  credential issuance that comes with its own problems of course 
  but in a local community right if you're never going to leave 
  your your little town then a credential from your teacher is 
  going to do pretty well compared to a piece of paper or no 
  credential at all right so kind of community issued Community 
  verified credentials that don't necessarily rely on this Tech 
  infrastructure but need to be stored in a space this could be 
  potentially.\
Kerri Lemoie:  Yeah I hear it documents a lot of Claire and Phil 
  to you we do we tend to talk about all of this in pretty broad 
  Strokes right now and we do that because we've been working at 
  the Sanders level right and you want to think about big wide 
  implications with standards that you're trying to fit in as much 
  as you can so it works in many different places and even 
  different context but it doesn't mean a thing I think is what I 
  also predict is what's going to happen is we're going to start 
  doing some very specific.\
Kerri Lemoie:   Civic implementations and those are going to work 
  and they're going to be the examples that are going to be models 
  for others to follow and then little.\
Kerri Lemoie:  Little we're going to we're going to build.\
Kerri Lemoie:  On that and I think we're headed into that this 
  year and next year really like banging out those examples whether 
  they're like hyper local or just Community or just like one 
  specific industry right as these start piling on we will start 
  seeing how they'll be applicable in other ways much like you know 
  email works and other things like that right you have to start 
  somewhere and then you build upon it yep specific and then 
  scale.\
Kerri Lemoie: +1 @Phil - exactly\
Dmitri Zagidulin: +1 Xander, I have the same concerns\
Xander_-_ASU/Pocket: I think you yes I actually I had a question 
  going back to the presentation a little bit about ipfs and the 
  decision to use it and maybe some of the thought process behind 
  that I know you mentioned encryption having a shelf life I think 
  we've looked at that solution in her still sort of considering it 
  but the concerns I'm wondering if Alan Curtis thought about her 
  what they're kind of thinking process might be room or related to 
  the permanence you know once you put something on ipfs.\
Xander_-_ASU/Pocket:  someone else.\
<kerri_lemoie> What I appreciate about the LearnCard SDK is that 
  it has contextual applicability planned for.\
Xander_-_ASU/Pocket: To continue to hold on to that content you 
  can never delete it you can't ever take it down and so if you've 
  got content on there which is encrypted and then maybe your key 
  becomes compromised somehow this is I'm just playing out my own 
  concerns here as an example you know you are you know basically 
  permanently exposed you can't take that stuff down your keys 
  exposed they can get everything you ever put on ipfs and you know 
  I think this is also tied into concerns around like right.\
Xander_-_ASU/Pocket:  be forgotten depending.\
Xander_-_ASU/Pocket: Ring there or even FERPA where you're 
  supposed to kind of give institutions the ability to pull back 
  student data if they want I know belongs to the learner and maybe 
  a very literal sense but there's wondering broadly if you 
  consider these sorts of issues and what you're thinking lesbian.\
<dmitri_zagidulin> the answer is to use user-controlled encrypted 
  storage! :) (like Encrypted Data Vaults)\
Cherie Duncan:  And oh yeah totally the fun thing is we don't 
  have an answer for that at the moment so I think we're thinking 
  for it and I know our developers are really cognizant of this 
  because yes there are definitely drawbacks to this kind of 
  architecture an ecosystem one thing you know again we really kind 
  of put an emphasis on this non is no deity in the call.\
Cherie Duncan:   So yeah we put it in.\
Cherie Duncan:  Said non-custodial T of credentials but it does 
  come with its drawbacks right it's not totally a foolproof 
  architecture and so we would love to problem solve with the 
  community and see ways that we could make it so that your Dimitri 
  encrypted data V user-controlled encrypted storage that is 
  amazing right we would love to create an application that allows 
  folks to do that instead of ipfs or other Solutions.\
Cherie Duncan:   So yeah.\
Cherie Duncan:  Sir but something to think about for us for 
  sure.\
Xander_-_ASU/Pocket: Now are you storing each credential 
  individually encrypted or is it like the whole wallet as a blob 
  or maybe I don't know maybe it's too detailed but I'm just 
  curious.\
Cherie Duncan:  Yeah each credential is individual in Krypton.\
<pl/t3_asu> @Dmitri that's decentralization to the individual! 
  And that's the best solution at present!\
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Sure I am so.\
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Spade or what I said in the chat it's by 
  itself is not sufficient as a solution so encrypted Data Vault is 
  a w3c ccg incubated spec that essentially.\
Dmitri Zagidulin:  A specifies how to do encryption plus 
  authorization on user controlled storage.\
Dmitri Zagidulin:  And so some of the some of the wallets out in 
  the space right now like some of the stuff that digital bazaars 
  doing and others use encrypted data V as the storage mechanism as 
  the back end to store the credentials which means it's not.\
Dmitri Zagidulin:  I-it's not out on the public internet it is on 
  a particular server that the user has addressed relationship with 
  but it's a due to the encryption it is a sort of greatly narrow 
  trust relationship and that combination is able to provide a 
  right to be forgotten.\
Dmitri Zagidulin:   Having said that.\
<simone_ravaioli> Is this the most updated repo @Dmitry 
  ?https://github.com/decentralized-identity/edv-spec\
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Has a wallet implementer DC myself I fully 
  understand the the tricky dilemma of okay so we have the spec 
  who's going to run the servers right and there that that's a 
  Community Wide discussion my personal hope is that the school's 
  themselves or whatever organizations our Consortium will be 
  operating the private encrypted servers for the learners.\
Dmitri Zagidulin:   All right.\
Dmitri Zagidulin:  We can get it to the point where storage is 
  like email right we've long sort of stopped wandering or at least 
  worrying about too much I who's gonna provide the email it's 
  standardized enough an inexpensive enough that it comes free in 
  your breakfast cereal meaning there's there's Gmail's on the 
  web-based emails but also your school provides that essentially 
  for free your internet service provider provides email and so on 
  encrypted storage can be just like that.\
Dmitri Zagidulin:   So but of course that's the future it 
  doesn't.\
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Now until a school or a Consortium steps 
  forward and says okay in addition to providing the wallet we will 
  run the storage servers the encrypted data of all type of stuff 
  so that's sort of a too long answer to your question thanks.\
Taylor_(LEF): Thanks this can be quick but I just wanted to sort 
  of lay some broader context and clarify that LEF really is sort 
  of a you know single Steward of some of this technology and as a 
  non-profit we are supporting the broader ecosystem its probe 
  obviously coming on and doing this sort of work but know that LEF 
  is not learn card our hope is really that it can be you know a 
  set of sort of plug-in based applications that anyone can kind of 
  for can use.\
<dmitri_zagidulin> @Simone - yep[, that's the spec!\
Kerri Lemoie: +1 @Taylor & LEF team\
Taylor_(LEF): As much as others are learning from us so just 
  wanted to point that out I think it's in some ways away we're 
  trying to distinguish ourselves and just the broader work from I 
  guess some of the more you know Central singular product-based 
  Implement implementations of some of the stuff so please take 
  ownership of learn card as much or as little as seems appropriate 
  but.\
Taylor_(LEF):  laf is.\
Taylor_(LEF): Learn card we are definitely excited about it and 
  want it to be useful and in this community and others but it is 
  open source for for reason so just wanted to clarify that if it 
  wasn't already.\
<kerri_lemoie> Thanks for join us today, @duncan & LEF!\
<pl/t3_asu> Thanks Duncan and the LEF team!\
<kerri_lemoie> Have a great week all!\
<duncan_cox> of course! Please reach out if you have qs.\
<taylor_(lef)> Thanks all \uc0\u55357 \u56911 \
<dave_montorio_-_weschool> thank you! bye\
