[2021-07-27T16:14:58.839Z]	<Mahmoud>	Juan: Happy to contextualize it, the VC-HTTP-API group had a few discussions about this mostly on github/mailing list and we discussed it on this call and just for the sake of trying to parallelize work and to break apart some open questions and bring back a defined package to it, as a concrete proposal. The conversation on github has been about which spec/ how to use/ how to constrain/ different types of json-ld interop in/out of scope etc. In terms of the work item if theres volunteers who want to help define the normative areas, we're looking for examples test vectors and more. Charles and I are looking for input and are happy to drive as editors and we're open to negotiation and concensus

[2021-07-27T16:16:24.466Z]	<Mahmoud>	Manu: Huge +1 to this work its important that it gets done, for those without backgroudn the vc jot stuff was injected to the VC spec at the 11th hour which resulted in a bunch of non-interop work. and the other thing i wanted to suggest is to feel free to break the VC spec , i think some decisions made on the VC spec last minute have not been great, and i think that the people who care about the VC jots should get together and do the right thing rather than follow VC spec ot the letter
[2021-07-27T16:16:27.906Z]	<by_caballero>	got it, will move fast and break everything, check

[2021-07-27T16:18:43.599Z]	<Manu_Sporny>	Yes, agree with Kristina... break the JWT-VC portion of the spec... not the entire VC spec. :)

[2021-07-27T16:20:16.103Z]	<Mahmoud>	Juan: many people are asking what is the division of labour, the DIF one is more of a conformance spec and this is more of an interop spec and it could include the JWS spec and others. and i think since a lot of us are participating in both we can keep the two aligned and non-redundant
[2021-07-27T16:20:26.808Z]	<Heather_Vescent>	ack cel

[2021-07-27T16:22:33.891Z]	<Mahmoud>	Juan: i think i can cover both in five minutes. the did:tz is specific to the tezos blockchain it has some sidetree bits attached and because theres two different teams in the tezos ecosystem we wanted to work on the spec together in the open, since we have two companies working together we thought it sbest to do it here.
[2021-07-27T16:22:51.155Z]	<Manu_Sporny>	q+ to ask if we are doing DID specs in this group, I thought we agreed to avoid it... but, if so, gonna add did:v1 to the discussion...
[2021-07-27T16:23:26.818Z]	<Orie>	its a registry for blockchain account identifierrs

[2021-07-27T16:24:28.872Z]	<Mahmoud>	...: the PKH one is similar to did:key and it lets you generate it from a pk hash which is a hash of a public key. and all the pkh are indexed in an open source way to assume certain things like if its this kind of BC address tis a hash of this kind of key. Its a place to hadnle all those transformations in an open source library. Its not really a full featured did method but its more like a more fully featured did:key. Were working with Joel who is more active in DID and that community and we want this to be a public community so please feel free to drop in

[2021-07-27T16:25:24.036Z]	<Mahmoud>	Manu: +1 supportive of both items, we had a discussion about if we do did:methods in the CCG and we had a decent chunk of the community that didn't want that, its mostly from people who are opposed to DLTs in the credentials. I think tis great that we can do that, and we definitely want to talk about did:v1/did:web/did:key in here aswell

[2021-07-27T16:25:50.223Z]	<Kristina>	I thought Juan framed this as NOT being a DID method exactly?

[2021-07-27T16:26:58.964Z]	<Mahmoud>	Heather: thats a great question, and perhaps this is also time for us to discuss what will be happening with the kind of work that was discussed in the DID working group. if its completing its work what happens to that work, do we want to take on some disucssions? my question to juan was are looking for an open meeting, are you looking for a new meeting or is this part of an existing meeting or is it part of ccg call?

[2021-07-27T16:27:44.310Z]	<Manu_Sporny>	See comment above, Orie ^^^
[2021-07-27T16:28:17.899Z]	<Manu_Sporny>	In other words, we've NOT been talking about Veres One in this group because we thought that would be bad form... but if form is changing... then :))))

[2021-07-27T16:30:12.327Z]	<Mahmoud>	Mike: I think that on the PKH side of things one of the things is its not the same as did:key or did:web but it has more similar properties to that as its not explicitly tied to one ledger or another. I think theres broad benefits from the community but i think manu is raising interesting points, do we really want to open the floodgates? but i think some things are beneficial from a broader community perspective
[2021-07-27T16:30:13.111Z]	<Kristina>	thanks for catching me up!

[2021-07-27T16:30:44.329Z]	<Mahmoud>	Juan: i don't want to drag this out but the PKH is more like DID:KEY than a blockchain did method, and for that reason i assumed its more like specifying did:key in ccg than did:btcr
[2021-07-27T16:31:07.746Z]	<mprorock>	it is a means of using did:key style stuff while pointing to external public keys - definitely interesting
[2021-07-27T16:31:11.131Z]	<Mahmoud>	...: and it has already been registered this was more of a consultative thing and gather use-cases and it isnt being specified in a way that is restrictive
[2021-07-27T16:31:13.659Z]	<cel>	did:pkh could potentially support non-blockchain public key hashes.

[2021-07-27T16:32:15.544Z]	<mprorock>	+1 multicodec might be an interesting path to take
[2021-07-27T16:32:17.379Z]	<Manu_Sporny>	/me was joking, we definitely don't want more DID Methods unless the new ones provide utility.
[2021-07-27T16:32:24.277Z]	<Heather_Vescent>	q?
[2021-07-27T16:32:46.116Z]	<Mahmoud>	Orie: Regarding the CIAP table it is in a way reinventing aspects of the multi-codec table but in a world where we ant these things to be did:key whether its a hash of a key or something. We can just register them in the multi-codec table and we can jsut expand did:key to support keys that are hashes of keys, its really not tha thard to do but there might be a really good reason to not extend did:key to support that thing. I'll note did:key has some snowflake properties
[2021-07-27T16:33:11.340Z]	<Heather_Vescent>	ack Wayne_C
[2021-07-27T16:33:12.938Z]	<Mahmoud>	Orie: similarly with BLS g1/g2 theres a key representation where you end up with 2 Public keys in one did:document
[2021-07-27T16:33:51.782Z]	<Heather_Vescent>	q?
[2021-07-27T16:34:44.129Z]	<Mahmoud>	Wayne: initial approach was to increase did:key, the CAIP-10 isn't normative, there might not be a CAIP-10 entry due to the fact that some of them aren't blockchains. One of the requirements is we aren't encoding in base58 or multi-codec as it mangles the string and you can no longer visually scan. if we can keep that in we can continue discussions about fitting in did:key.

[2021-07-27T16:38:07.779Z]	<Mahmoud>	...: EDV we're really looking at a number of use cases, how do we make storage providers a commodity and make it confidential so the provider does not see the data, how do we unified across devices and sharing across groups? how do we ensure continues backup mechanism? how do we store data off the DLT to protect from compromise? how do we do wallet data portability, and how do we use with ID hub?
[2021-07-27T16:39:42.261Z]	<Mahmoud>	...: the suggestion is EDVs has a place in all the use cases. 
The first use case is when an individual wants to store data in a provider but make sure they cannot be eavesdropped. An org wants to store trade secrets with an external provider and make sure the provider cant access or in case of a leak they cannot be compromised: think encrypted Google Drive or Encrypted Dropbox. We need a unified encrypted storage interface, this doesn't exist at the layer we're talking about. No standard that says by default they cannot eavesdrop.
[2021-07-27T16:40:03.223Z]	<Orie>	Sounds more like standards compliant "last pass"
[2021-07-27T16:40:48.011Z]	<Mahmoud>	...: the second case is Unified Storage, a lot of the cases sound like dropbox/gdrive/ondrive with a twist that its encrypted. The idea behind unified storage is you use multiple devices and the devices are available regardless of which device. The other important thing is if you lose your device you don't have to worry about data loss.
[2021-07-27T16:40:59.477Z]	<Mahmoud>	...: i think this is like a standards compliant Last Pass.
[2021-07-27T16:41:31.913Z]	<Kayode_Ezike>	present+
[2021-07-27T16:42:11.650Z]	<Mahmoud>	...: the other thing is they are trying to unify the way we share stuff, how do we have a vault where the doctor/patient/hospital access records and help them do the job they need to do while respective the patient's agency. This has lots to do with auth to access in a standards way. If you think now most apps that do sharing aren't standardized and thats what we're trying to do
[2021-07-27T16:43:17.531Z]	<Mahmoud>	...: there's also a continuous backup use case where if you have zero-trust, either to always be there or to not snoop, i.e. if a company explodes for w.e reason. Because storage is cheap its easy to replicate things to your own home and devices. You cannot be held hostage to their TOS or being a perma-customer et.c
[2021-07-27T16:43:26.999Z]	<Mahmoud>	...: automatic failover resync on recovery.
[2021-07-27T16:44:10.124Z]	<Mahmoud>	...: theres also offdata storage, like in the case of supply chains, you don't really want to store encrypted data to a ledger as it always has a shelf life, what you want to do is point to where the data is stored off ledger.
[2021-07-27T16:45:08.942Z]	<Mahmoud>	...: Finally when talking about VCs and credential repositories, one way is to give the individual to switch data providers, in theory, and we want this to be the ideal you should be able to change the provider and you can split the storage of credentials from teh entity giving you the digital wallet.

[2021-07-27T16:45:30.999Z]	<Mahmoud>	...: theres an ID hub backing storage, to use EDV. We've spent a lot of time to align them
[2021-07-27T16:46:17.723Z]	<Mahmoud>	...: What does an EDV actually do? EDVS are simple things: they let you store files in an encrypted fashio nin a vault: 5 operations CREATe READ UPDATE DELETE QUERY. theres some share stuff as well but you can think of it as a folder.
[2021-07-27T16:46:36.891Z]	<Mahmoud>	all operations between individual and EDV client is unencrypted but once it hits the EDV server it only sees encrypted data.

[2021-07-27T16:50:50.510Z]	<Manu_Sporny>	I don't know if we have a list anywhere
[2021-07-27T16:50:51.026Z]	<Mahmoud>	Dimitri: Current status is it is actively being worked on by a Joint working group by CCG and DIF, weekly calls and we have two specs, they are not chartered for work groups. Challenges to adoption: one of the challenges is that unlike other storage services which manage your encryption keys for you, one of the core goals is you and your client/software manage your keys. The storage provider don't have any access to your data. The reason is that managing encryption keys is still a very new and a challenge from both human UI, and from a tooling and library perspective. We feel its overcome-able with the usual array of tools, user education etc.
[2021-07-27T16:51:00.683Z]	<Kristina>	oh ok, I thought I heard there are in the question, thanks!

[2021-07-27T16:51:55.595Z]	<Mahmoud>	Phil: there seems like theres an implication of digital wallets or a spec of digital wallet, A has that entered design considerations here? and secondly how would this work within the context of the actual process of creating a VP from the wallet or does it not matter how the storage is abstracted?

[2021-07-27T16:52:52.737Z]	<Mahmoud>	Dimitri: it is very much a part of the design consideration of the group, it was the primary use case we started with. we didn't want to presume people would use EDVs as backing stores, and most shouldn't assume EDVs behind the scenes, but EDVs have good stories to tell in data portability and not being locked into vendors etc.

[2021-07-27T16:55:27.342Z]	<Orie>	our implementation uses mongo db as backing store, but the interface is pretty easy to implement.
[2021-07-27T16:56:02.889Z]	<by_caballero>	very pluggable! semantics! it handles everything! all it cares about is JSON blobs!

[2021-07-27T16:57:04.920Z]	<Mahmoud>	Dimitri: ID hubs are another task force of the  Secure data storage working group, they're a higher level spec, if EDVS deal with low level crud ID hubs are more towards the higher ends, personal data store end of spectrum. it is not focused on encryption more on public data. it is IPFS based storage core, with a layer of application logic on top with an auth layer. one of the goals being transparent replication between a person's various hubs.
[2021-07-27T16:58:00.003Z]	<Mahmoud>	...: Hubs can be easy to use and convenient data storage applications for many clients, there's an intended level of interops with DIDs  you'll find ID hub section in your DID document in order to reference a file you'd use a DID:URL reference a did:resolver and fetch a file from it.
[2021-07-27T16:58:45.199Z]	<Kristina>	if you can access EDV using DID, will that make it also an ID Hub? probably a silly question
[2021-07-27T16:59:03.615Z]	<Mahmoud>	Kaliya: the storage will serve users if it has some understanding of the metadata around particular types of data for EX. my playlist, while the hub will not see the playlist it will know there is a playlist inside of it and share it on my behalf.
[2021-07-27T16:59:17.926Z]	<Manu_Sporny>	Kristina, not a silly question ... Hubs are a layer on top of EDVs (at least that's what's expected right now)
[2021-07-27T16:59:41.168Z]	<Kristina>	ok, so more like ID Hub be btw user and EDV like in EDV presentation
[2021-07-27T16:59:45.780Z]	<Mahmoud>	Dimitri: what you're seeing here is public collections are the primary use case, to support to do lists music etc. this doesnt show the auth layer but there is one between you and your data.
[2021-07-27T17:00:03.270Z]	<Manu_Sporny>	Kristina, yep, exactly.
