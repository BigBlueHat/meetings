[2021-08-17T20:19:49.277Z]	<mprorock>	agropper: wants to state that he views this the way that justin does - one person has to do with process - resolution had some majority
[2021-08-17T20:20:26.369Z]	<mprorock>	agropper: if we want to talk about a principled objection to the process that is one thing - if we want to revisit the proposal as passed, that is a separate issue
[2021-08-17T20:20:48.403Z]	<mprorock>	manu: ask for counter proposals? we can re-run proposal again

[2021-08-17T20:22:10.431Z]	<Michael_Herman_(Trusted_Digital_Web)>	Why am I only hearing Adrian? ...an no one else.  An interesting conversation but definitely 1-sided ;-)

[2021-08-17T20:22:43.274Z]	<Orie>	everyone can see that folks don't agree to the resolution... I suggest we make the WG notes and specs reflect the WG consensus. No consensus, no resolutions :)

[2021-08-17T20:24:17.668Z]	<mprorock>	justin: ultimate concern around resolution itself is what harm is caused by the text of the resolution for the spec
[2021-08-17T20:25:10.972Z]	<mprorock>	... believe this to be a simple matter and does not understand rejection of GNAP, etc
[2021-08-17T20:25:25.458Z]	<Orie>	we don't need to say anything about GNAP if folks can't agree its a good idea... same thing is true of WebAuthN or DID ION :)
[2021-08-17T20:25:32.917Z]	<mprorock>	... only arguments i have heard are don't understand, or like, or not ready yet
[2021-08-17T20:26:00.341Z]	<mprorock>	... if WG later decides to cut it for harm reasons then it can be cut then

[2021-08-17T20:27:30.320Z]	<mprorock>	... too early when neither spec is yet finalized

[2021-08-17T20:40:33.101Z]	<cel>	GNAP on our (Spruce's) roadmap, but we cannot commit to a schedule right now
[2021-08-17T20:40:56.632Z]	<mprorock>	manu: would like to strike a balance by delaying conversation around gnap for 6months
[2021-08-17T20:41:18.558Z]	<Adrian_Gropper>	+1 to keep resolution as is and delay for some months
[2021-08-17T20:41:23.809Z]	<mprorock>	... allows focus on other issues, but does not remove it entirely from discussion
[2021-08-17T20:41:38.571Z]	<mprorock>	... keep resolution as is, but delay any action and reviisit
[2021-08-17T20:41:45.734Z]	<Justin_Richer>	I'm personally fine with a delay because there was never a time constraint to address
[2021-08-17T20:41:53.881Z]	<mprorock>	agropper: fine with a delay
[2021-08-17T20:42:25.624Z]	<mprorock>	manu: wants a concrete time, suggests and asks for preference in time range
[2021-08-17T20:42:33.341Z]	<mprorock>	agropper: no set time range
[2021-08-17T20:43:00.106Z]	<mprorock>	jandrieu: correct pr to not act on this resolution
[2021-08-17T20:43:23.633Z]	<mprorock>	manu: what about changing pr to note resolution?
[2021-08-17T20:43:52.773Z]	<mprorock>	jandrieu: what about overall process - wg resolution then carried to main group
[2021-08-17T20:43:54.519Z]	<mprorock>	q+
[2021-08-17T20:44:03.183Z]	<manu>	ack manu
[2021-08-17T20:44:24.139Z]	<mprorock>	jow: missing chain and lacking leadership on group and process not documented and this is creating the issues
[2021-08-17T20:44:24.351Z]	<Orie>	chairs of the ccg arbitrate, and if they fail, W3C leadership is involved i assume...
[2021-08-17T20:44:39.088Z]	<manu>	ack manu
[2021-08-17T20:44:39.894Z]	<mprorock>	jandrieu: must fix process
[2021-08-17T20:44:40.956Z]	<manu>	ack mpro
[2021-08-17T20:45:42.078Z]	<manu>	mprorock: From a Chair standpoint, checked in w/ W3C -- Joe's noting something important - we have not clearly stated how to handle that for individual graoups -- we could state in CCG that Editors can act in that role, but typically things are being read from my perspective, from W3C, in this case, it should raise up to Editors of spec, if resolution couldn't be found there, escalated to CCG Chairs.
[2021-08-17T20:46:30.745Z]	<manu>	mprorock: From there, back into W3C proper if it escalated beyond there -- I do agree with Joe, a lot of this is lack of well defined process, creating situation to begin with. If we don't get some of this stuff addressed, we're going to circle back to this point, that concerns me, the issue is just a symptom.
[2021-08-17T20:46:35.716Z]	<manu>	q+
[2021-08-17T20:46:38.183Z]	<mprorock>	mprorock: thanks for scribing me, manu
[2021-08-17T20:47:10.685Z]	<mprorock>	manu: trying to decide whether or not to push this issue - specifically did not call self chair because that can be harmful
[2021-08-17T20:47:12.680Z]	<Joe_Andrieu>	q+ to say we have neither a chair nor an editor
[2021-08-17T20:47:34.446Z]	<Justin_Richer>	+1 to moving on and solve process issues in parallel -- this isn't a W3C Process WG
[2021-08-17T20:47:37.913Z]	<mprorock>	... better to have group cohesion and be able to move on than to dwell on issues
[2021-08-17T20:47:56.620Z]	<manu>	ack manu
[2021-08-17T20:47:57.550Z]	<mprorock>	manu: does not want to force a process meta issue
[2021-08-17T20:47:57.792Z]	<manu>	ack Joe
[2021-08-17T20:48:44.793Z]	<mprorock>	jandrieu: notes that chair has raised similar concerns
[2021-08-17T20:48:53.742Z]	<mprorock>	... group does not have an editor or chair
[2021-08-17T20:48:54.837Z]	<Orie>	we do have editors
[2021-08-17T20:48:55.418Z]	<Orie>	https://github.com/w3c-ccg/vc-http-api/blob/main/CODEOWNERS
[2021-08-17T20:49:01.957Z]	<Mahmoud>	dont we have four editors?
[2021-08-17T20:49:14.462Z]	<Orie>	these folks are editors
[2021-08-17T20:49:15.368Z]	<Orie>	@peacekeeper @msporny @mavarley @OR13 @mkhraisha
[2021-08-17T20:49:17.513Z]	<mprorock>	... concerned about possibility for process changing between meetings when blocks are hit
[2021-08-17T20:49:21.360Z]	<Orie>	I am one of them
[2021-08-17T20:49:26.834Z]	<mprorock>	... existential concerns over process
[2021-08-17T20:49:32.270Z]	<mprorock>	+1
[2021-08-17T20:49:39.674Z]	<Orie>	q+
[2021-08-17T20:49:39.814Z]	<Justin_Richer>	Nobody's saying to ignore the problem, they're saying that this group has other work to do while the process is also fixed
[2021-08-17T20:49:49.483Z]	<mprorock>	manu: notes we do have editors and code owners - they also are on the call
[2021-08-17T20:49:54.584Z]	<mprorock>	q+
[2021-08-17T20:50:09.393Z]	<mprorock>	manu: thinks chairs need to step in and make a ruling
[2021-08-17T20:50:22.505Z]	<TallTed>	q+
[2021-08-17T20:50:30.553Z]	<mprorock>	... suggest that we elect a group chair and check for obj to existing editors next call
[2021-08-17T20:50:34.019Z]	<manu>	ack Orie
[2021-08-17T20:50:42.572Z]	<mprorock>	orie: agree that ccg chairs should step in
[2021-08-17T20:50:57.466Z]	<mprorock>	... no editor should ever implement a resolution that does not have consensus
[2021-08-17T20:51:31.083Z]	<mprorock>	... editor is responisible for impl consensus, not what they think is best
[2021-08-17T20:51:36.350Z]	<Justin_Richer>	One note, often real consensus can't be reached until there is concrete text to discuss. It's the editors' job to get people there.
[2021-08-17T20:51:46.563Z]	<Orie>	+1 justin
[2021-08-17T20:51:57.610Z]	<Orie>	we can always add stuff later, if consensus is reaccheed
[2021-08-17T20:52:05.810Z]	<manu>	mprorock: I can note from the Chairs meeting, this is a topic of concern at the Chair level, we have decided that we will be making adjustments to make PR to process docs to clarify this.
[2021-08-17T20:52:16.759Z]	<Justin_Richer>	So I don't disagree in principle with Orie but you can put stuff into the draft spec and say "hey the editors did this, let's talk about it"
[2021-08-17T20:52:27.120Z]	<manu>	mrprorock: If there is a concrete proposal that you would like to take to the Chairs, please feel free to send that over to Chairs as a group.
[2021-08-17T20:52:34.330Z]	<Justin_Richer>	Waiting for the group to agree on every detail is a recipe for never moving forward, in my experience.
[2021-08-17T20:52:39.716Z]	<manu>	q?
[2021-08-17T20:52:42.160Z]	<manu>	ack mprorock
[2021-08-17T20:52:43.788Z]	<manu>	ack Tallted
[2021-08-17T20:53:16.872Z]	<mprorock>	ted: clear from discussion and way folks are speaking that there is no consistency in the group - this appears to be a subcomittee on a work item that is vague to begin with
[2021-08-17T20:53:42.432Z]	<mprorock>	... CGs don't have a lot of process forced by w3c
[2021-08-17T20:54:24.779Z]	<mprorock>	... this whole controversy is over a vague item that was vaguely decided
[2021-08-17T20:54:39.551Z]	<mprorock>	... people are willing to block all progress based on vague items
[2021-08-17T20:55:25.132Z]	<mprorock>	... high value in loose coupling and that is what we need
[2021-08-17T20:55:42.221Z]	<Mike_Varley>	+1 to loose coupling.
[2021-08-17T20:55:52.138Z]	<Justin_Richer>	+1 to loose coupling
[2021-08-17T20:56:00.470Z]	<Orie>	I could live with OAuth2.0 until something better exists... but I'm an engineer...
[2021-08-17T20:56:24.474Z]	<mprorock>	... yes there was clumsiness in process, but becuase we are not acting like any other group, therefore there will be issues, but we are where we are - and we are trying to produce something of value, hopefully also to the outside world
[2021-08-17T20:56:46.308Z]	<mprorock>	... if we can agree on top level goals, assume all are trying to work in good faith then we can move forward
[2021-08-17T20:57:15.602Z]	<mprorock>	... and hopefully gets us somewhere as opposed to trying to get things to get to a perfect process point
[2021-08-17T20:57:39.552Z]	<mprorock>	manu: if you would like to see something concrete - please send to mailing list for ccg chairs to consider
[2021-08-17T20:57:57.748Z]	<mprorock>	... future calls will focus on concrete issues that we can act on
[2021-08-17T20:58:20.772Z]	<mprorock>	... we are way down in meta and process, and people are here to build whatever the vc-http-api is
[2021-08-17T20:58:39.963Z]	<mprorock>	... next week will be hearing from others on their apis and will be discussing scoping
[2021-08-17T20:58:58.039Z]	<mprorock>	... this is it - thanks all
