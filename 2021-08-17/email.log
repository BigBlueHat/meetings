Topic: Main Agenda: Branding and Naming Considerations

Heather Vescent:  Considering branding and naming
  ... I used to be an expert, this screen share is from my 
  archive
<mprorock> have eyes on queue
  ... wanted to cover high points on branding and naming
  ... a brand is a promise to customers
  ... there are many different kinds of names
  ... descriptive names, suggestive or associative, arbitrary 
  names, fanciful, inventive, clever, acronyms, geographic and 
  founder based names
  ... branding isn't always about you.... its about where you 
  are, and how you are perceived, and your end goal.
  ... who is your target audience?
  ... naming is under the brand, its part of what is this 
  thing...
  ... reflecting on naming, there is a cycle
  ... in beginning things have a first name, just to get 
  started... as the product evolves the first name starts to have a 
  gap with where it is today
  ... then people want to change the name, since its not being 
  helpful
  ... I have noticed a certain group of folks want to use 
  descriptive names and be precise
  ... sometimes being descriptive is a bad idea, when you don't 
  know what it is.
  ... then descriptive names change again...
  ... does anyone know the story of the term "Open Source"
<tallted> yup
Charles E. Lehner:  I have heard it
Heather Vescent:  Who coined the term?
<tallted> RMS, I believe
<mprorock> esr
<charles_e._lehner> I think it was a woman
<manu_sporny> I definitely haven't heard of the origin story of 
  "Open Source"... just assumed it was ESR or someone like that.
https://opensource.com/article/18/2/coining-term-open-source-software
Heather Vescent:  It was Christine Peterson
  ...  she is my friend
  ... the term was used to make the space easier for new folks to 
  understand, and was better than "free software", that focused on 
  code and not price.
  ... the name was needed to help the technology become 
  understandable
  ... think about your audience
  ... maybe we should name things for the folks outside this 
  community, not the folks inside.
<bobwyman> There was  a time when we called open source "DECUS 
  tapes...."
  ... precision and descriptive names make it hard for outsiders 
  to understand things
Mike Schwartz:  ESR was first, Christine brought it up at 
  netscape
Adrian Gropper:  What are we naming?
Heather Vescent:  All the things, including work items
<mprorock> scribe correct - ESR was first publication - Christine 
  suggested term originally in a brainstorm session
Adrian Gropper:  Its helpful to name the thing for people who you 
  hope will drive adoption
  .... maybe we should name 1 thing first
  ... can we agree that we need an anchor for what we have been 
  calling SSI?
  ... do we need an other word for SSI?
Heather Vescent:  Christine was not a core member or in a 
  powerful position, and its why she could see the Kool-aid
  ... I suspect we won't use the term SSI, but someone outside 
  our community will help name what we are doing....
  ... the person who names our work, won't be a part of our work
Manu Sporny:  This is all great... some of things we are 
  naming... I keep hoping some journalist will help us name things
  ... I feel that folks inside can't name things
  ...  "the web" is what people call HTTP and HTML
  ... folks tend not to name the higher order thing
  ... we should consider the higher order thing
  ... I hope the term SSI does not catch on
  ... maybe there is something better than VCs
  ... examples of names: VC-HTTP-API, Linked Data Signatures, 
  Linked Data Proofs, Linked Data Integrity
  ... folks who are not engaged trying to name the thing, for 
  things it does not do
  ... naming is important, need to consider both sides
<manu> I'll scribe for Orie.
Heather Vescent:  Please be brief
Orie Steele:  Naming is one of the hardest things that humans do, 
  it's also one of the most important things. I like what Manu said 
  about the Web... descriptive names have a place, non-descriptive 
  higher order names have a place. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]
Orie Steele:  As an engineer, I require descriptive names, it's 
  how I understand what it is they're trying to do... if they're 
  trying to do HTML but calling it something different, that's a 
  problem for me. It's important not to abandon descriptive names, 
  but it's also important not to stop at them. [scribe assist by 
  Manu Sporny]
Orie Steele:  Descriptive names are helpful to update as the 
  thing they're describing requires them to change. You also need 
  bigger picture, fluffier names that are more welcoming. You also 
  don't want to destroy the technical communities ability to also 
  specifically identify what they're talking about. [scribe assist 
  by Manu Sporny]
Andrew Hughes:  Maybe a project code name is useful in the 
  beginning
Orie Steele: +1 To project naming
Andrew Hughes:  Sometimes delaying naming, or descriptive names 
  is useful
  ... that can help
Manu Sporny: +1 To what Bob is saying.
<manu> Maybe what we're talking about is the "Verifiable Web"?
Bob Way:  HTML, HTTP are component names... the overall system, 
  the fact that higher order concepts have various other names, is 
  ok
  ... the term web predates, some of these technologies, and 
  their assembly occurred
<heather_vescent> Oooh, I like that Verifiable Web...
  ... Web != HTML / HTTP
  ... after we put these things together, what is the thing that 
  results from it?
  ... what is the emergent system?
Heather Vescent:  Speakers?

Topic: Branding Tips from Kerri, Kimberly, Moses and Manu

<agropper_> The result of this work might be decentralization
<manu_sporny> Kerri is here! :P
<manu_sporny> She just joined.
<kerri_lemoie> Hello :)
<heather_vescent> â€¢	Name it for the end audience not the builder: 
  Sometimes the end audience are the developers, but oftentimes the 
  end audience are CTOs, CIOs, funders, investors, media, or users 
  who may not be as technically informed. Consider a name that 
  works for developers and end audience. 
Kerri Lemoie:  Avoid acronyms...
Can we get a link to deck for notes?
<moses> Yes.
Kimberly Linson:  I echo these points... I am curious about the 
  technology
  ... find myself asking a lot of "why?"
<moses> My slides are at: 
  https://www.dropbox.com/s/743p67d2dbeca98/CCG%20naming.pptx?dl=0
  ... its all about adoption, that has to be somewhere when we 
  think about naming
  ... names are sticky...
Kerri Lemoie: +1 To sticky names
  ... its hard to fix names, sometimes its helpful not to put a 
  name on a thing until you understand it
<andrew_hughes> Project One for One might actually work for 
  credential exchange! :)
<heather_vescent> LOL Andrew, perfect
  ... once the decision is made, we need to support the name.
  ... its important that voting results be supported
Moses Ma: Book: 
  https://www.amazon.com/Soulful-Branding-Unlock-Hidden-Company/dp/1515114414
Moses Ma:  Branding is emotional not logical
  ... think visual, and stories
  ... keep it short
<tallted> +1000 visually diagrammed benefits!
  ... finding the hidden power in your brand, and understanding 
  the subtext
  ... we need to think like a republican
  ... tap into peoples emotions
<juan_caballero_(spruce)> i see more slides!
<andrew_hughes> I love the "fire trucks are really water trucks"
<juan_caballero_(spruce)> s/ want to/
"Slack is a productivity tool"
"Google theory of negativity"
Moses Ma:  We should consider is this the wild west, tap into the 
  fear
Manu Sporny:  We need to access the right emotion, this is about 
  safety
  ... verifiable web helps folks feel safe
  ... the words, issuer, holder, verifier, verifiable data 
  registry
  ... we named things by committee...
  ... surprisingly successful
  ... we needed to get buy in from the folks who participate
  ... everyone needs to be able to see the data
  ... it does not always work
  ... voting is just 1 more input
  ... we avoid simple majority decisions
<bobwyman> The eventual common name for what emerges from this 
  work will probably be more descriptive or evocative of the 
  "experience" of using the components rather than describing any 
  of the qualities of those components.
  ... the goal is to get the community to agree too what to call 
  things
Heather Vescent:  The point was to be proactive
Moses Ma:  If we ask Jerome to come in, it would be useful... 
  however, we would need to give him something
  ... maybe we trade with him / time for time?
Orie Steele:  Sometimes there are "standards" and "community 
  perspective" on them, and then wider non-technical stakeholder, 
  and then specific companies that build a brand on the monopoly or 
  interpretation on those standards. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]
Orie Steele:  What I've seen is one community using wording that 
  latches on to standards brand, and there will be people building 
  businesses on top of open standards, we should be sensitive to 
  existing branding, but think about how people will brand their 
  services to their customers. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]
Orie Steele:  We shouldn't attempt to pick the word that they use 
  so we give them that ability to do that. [scribe assist by Manu 
  Sporny]
<moses> bye all!
